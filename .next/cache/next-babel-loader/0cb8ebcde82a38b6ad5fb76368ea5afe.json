What we are saying is this – this project the way you are looking at it, it is as if it is an exclusively presidential project,” he stated.\\n\\nThe senator, while responding to a question, said the conception of the programme was not exclusive to the presidency, explaining that its conception, approval and funding are with the considered input of the National Assembly because it believes it’s going to be beneficial for the purpose of addressing the challenges of COVID-19.\\nAccording to him, government revolves around the three arms – executive, legislative and judiciary.\\n\\nHe said: “On your perspective on encroaching on the powers of the president, there is no exclusivity in terms of any programme that is to be implemented, except the National Assembly is not part of government. Government, as defined by the 1999 Constitution, has three components: legislative powers as stipulated in Section 4; executive powers Section 5 and the judicial power in Section 6.\\n\\n“It is the totality of these that constitute government. So, when you are saying the government is doing a programme, it is not President Muhammadu Buhari that is doing the programme; it is the government of the people. Implementation, appropriation and execution all rolled into one. There is no dichotomy such as encroaching on the powers of the president.\\n\\n“Assuming the National Assembly is opposed to the programme, we could not have approved it. You cannot appropriate, but we want to be sure that names don’t just fly.\\n\\n“The two chambers of the National Assembly asked the federal government to halt the programme until the implementation modalities are explained to the legislative arm.”\\n\\nBasiru and his counterpart in the House of Representatives, Hon. Benjamin Kalu, in a joint statement, said the suspension of the scheme was necessitated because the lawmakers were concerned about the proper and effective implementation of the scheme.\\n\\nThey also mandated their Committees on Labour and Employment to immediately invite the Minister of Labour and Employment and any other officials of the ministry to appear before the joint committee to brief it on the modality for the implementation of the engagement of 774,000 persons for public works.\\n\\nThe lawmakers said they want to ensure transparency of the process just as it was done with the National Social Register by the Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development.\\n\\nThe two-page statement read in part: ”The National Assembly reminds members of the public that the legislature as part of the conception of the programme, approved it and appropriated funds for its implementation as part of the COVID-19 response strategy. In accordance with the constitutional imperative of oversight, the legislature being important stakeholders in the democratic process, and elected representatives of the people needed to be appraised of modalities for implementation for effective feedback to our constituents and in ensuring that our constituents optimally participate in and benefit from the process. In view of the foregoing, the implementation of the programme shall be on hold pending proper briefing of the National Assembly.”\\n\\nKeyamo had engaged the federal lawmakers in a shouting match on Tuesday over the modalities for the implementation of the 774,000 public works recruitment which resulted in the minister being walked out over his refusal to apologise to the legislators for his comments.\\n\\nHowever, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, yesterday said the leadership of the House had commenced moves to resolve the face-off between the National Assembly and Keyamo.\\n\\nGbajabiamila, when he appeared at the Public Accounts Committee’s public hearing in Abuja, said the seeming differences would be resolved amicably within the next 24 hours.\\n\",\n  \"createdAt\": \"2020-07-02T09:30:32.716Z\",\n  \"creatorId\":

and Crime (UNODC) says some 35.6 million people suffer from drug use disorders globally.\\n\\nThis data is contained in an address by the Executive Director of UNODC, Ghada Waly, who called for global solidarity and compassion in addressing world drug problem.\\nAround 269 million people used drugs in 2018, up 30 per cent from 2009, according to the statement released by Sylvester Tunde Atere, Outreach and Communications, UNODC Nigeria Country Office, Abuja.\\n\\n\\n \\n“While the increase reflects population growth and other factors, illicit drugs – including opiates and pharmaceutical opioids, cocaine and methamphetamine – are still more available, more diverse and more potent than before, challenging law enforcement, posing greater health risks and complicating efforts to prevent and treat drug use disorders,” the executive director said.\\n\\nThe statement said adolescents and young adults account for the largest share of those using drugs. Of the 11 million people who inject drugs, half of them are living with hepatitis C, and 1.4 million with HIV.\\n\\n“Only one out of eight people who need drug-related treatment receive it. One out of three drug users is a woman but women represent only one out of five people in treatment. People in prison settings, minorities, immigrants and displaced people also face barriers to treatment due to discrimination and stigma.\\n\\n“585,000 died in 2017 in relation to drug use, up one-quarter from 2008. Over the past decade, the total number of deaths due to opioid use disorders went up 71 per cent, with a 92 per cent increase among women compared with 63 per cent among men.\\n\\n“All over the world, we see that risks and consequences of drug use are worsened by poverty, limited opportunities for education and jobs, stigma and social exclusion, which in turn helps to deepen inequalities, moving us further away from achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.”\\n\\nHe said the COVID-19 crisis has intensified these challenges further still, overwhelming health systems and exposing the fragility of institutions and social safety nets.\\n\\nHe said the theme of this year’s International Day against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking, “Better Knowledge for Better Care”, highlights the need to understand drug dynamics trapping so many millions of people in a downward spiral, to inform balanced solutions that are based on scientific evidence, to know better what the issues are and to provide better care for those who need it.\\n\\nHealth-centred, rights-based and gender-responsive approaches to drug use and related diseases deliver better public health, and we need to do more to share this learning and support implementation, most of all in developing countries.\\n\\n“Governments pledged to advance such balanced, comprehensive and evidence-based responses in the 2019 CND Ministerial Declaration. In the COVID-19 recovery, we need all countries to act on their commitments, and show shared responsibility to tackle illicit drug supply and reduce demand. We need civil society and youth organisations to continue their efforts to support the vulnerable in their communities.\\n\\n“Together, we can pursue more effective prevention and protection, to build resilience as we build back better, and leave no one behind.”\\n\",\n  \"createdAt\": \"2020-07-02T08:29:55.769Z\",\n  \"creatorId\": \"UbDb4ITEdd-J\"\n}, {\n  \"_id\": \"KRMRAR-4BrSzsKxlJxHDq\",\n  \"image_link\": \"https://storage.googleapis.com/thisday-846548948316-wp-data/wp-media/2020/06/c0c03e5e-fr-arazu-696x522.jpg\",\n  \"caption\": \"COVID-19: The Madagascar Challenge and Nigeria’s Traditional Medicine Practitioners\",\n  \"author\": \"\",\n  \"source\": \"ThisDay\",\n  \"source_link\": \"https://www.thisdaylive.com/index.php/2020/06/25/covid-19-the-madagascar-challenge-and-nigerias-traditional-medicine-practitioners/\",\n  \"category\": \"health\",\n  \"headings\": \"not\",\n  \"abstract_cat\": \"none\",\n  \"content\": \"David-Chyddy Eleke writes on claims by Rev Fr Arazu of inventing a herbal drug for COVID-19 while juxtaposing the Madagascar herbal mixture and the possibility of traditional medicine practitioners in Nigeria utilising a rich blend of herbs and roots to combat the rampaging pandemic\\n\\nRecently, President Muhammadu Buhari took delivery of a large consignment of COVID-19 herbal remedy, a product that allegedly cures the virus, and produced in Madagascar. The drugs were delivered by the president of Guinea Bisau, President Umaro Embalo.\\n\\n\\n \\nBuhari, receiving the consignment said he would wait for science to authenticate it before it could be put to use.\\n\\nBut back in Madagascar, President of the country, Andry Rajoelini had claimed that the remedy was already working ‘wonders’ for its people against the disease. This may have also prompted the purchase of the drug by the Ghanaian government and even Guinea Bisau.\\n\\nNigeria parades a huge number of traditional medicine practitioners who have also laid claims to several inventions which cures other diseases, and most people believe that if given the opportunity, traditional medicine practitioners can doing a surprise with the invention of the drug for COVID-19.\\n\\nDr Timothy Nkem, though a medical doctor told THISDAY that he cannot expressly dismiss the place of herbal medicine in the society. “I have been a medical doctor for several years, but I can testify to miracles that herbal remedies have worked in the lives of some of my patients. It may not be the same for everybody, but truth is there are people whose systems are more at home with those local drugs,” he said.\\n\\nAlready, the Chairman of Anambra State Traditional Medicine Board, Rev Fr Raymond Arazu has laid claims to the invention of a drug against the virus. In a recent interview with THISDAY, Father Arazu, a Holy Ghost father of the Catholic Church and a renowned traditional medicine practitioner of over 50 years practice, who is in his 90s, and fondly referred to as the living ancestor described the the invention of a herbal drug for COVID-19 by Madagascar as a challenge to Nigeria.\\n\\nHe said, “I cannot imagine a small nation like Madagascar boasting of a remedy for the novel Coronavirus, while Nigerian government is yet to accept the fact that some traditional medicine practitioners in Nigeria including himself have already invented a cure for the ailment.”\\n\\nArazu said that immediately after the news of the outbreak of the disease in China filtered out in December last year, his team, led by himself and his nephew, Mr Reginald Arazu, graduate of Chemistry, a known scientist and a traditional medicine practitioner went to work.\\n\\n“We studied the symptoms of the disease and found out that it operates like every other viral disease, except a little difference, which is that it is airborne. We cure viral disease here, and all we needed to do was to look at its symptoms, and now ensure that we find drugs that can work more effectively in curing most of those symptoms exhibited by the patients of the virus.\\n\\n“We came up with this drug (beckoning on a sachet powder on his table). We named it Chioma. We have treated patients who are showing symptoms of COVID-19 here, but when people come to consult with us and they tell us the symptoms, for the ones we suspect COVID-19, we have treated them. But what we will not do is to treat anyone who comes to us knowing he has the COVID-19. We simply tell them to contact NCDC (National Centre for Disease Control), because we are not allowed to treat them. But if someone comes and tells us the symptoms of his sickness, sometimes we suspect COVID-19 and we treat them and they get well.”\\n\\nArazu said there are other members of the Anambra Traditional Medicine Board who have also invented supposed cure for the COVID-19, and that they have met with the representatives of the Anambra State governor, Chief Willie Obiano who has also promised to push forward the invention to the federal government for approval.\\n\\nSpeaking of the World Health Organisation (WHO), usual dismissal of herbal inventions, Arazu regretted that those who knows nothing about the efficacy of herbal medicine are condemning inventions from Africa for the novel virus, when it has not been able to come up with solution themselves.\\n\\n“They call us unorthordox medicine, but in the real sense, traditional drugs are the orthodox ones, while they are the unorthordox ones. Traditional Medicine has always been there from the begining of creation. I have been in this business for over 50 years. I am a priest, I am not doing this to make money but my own way of helping humanity.\\n\\n“This drug (Chioma) underwent very thorough research before we came up with it. Though we have been told that the state governor will help see to its approval, but we know that the virus we are up against cannot wait for all the beaurocratic bottlenecks of government, so time is of essence.”\\n\\nReginald Arazu who manages Arazu’s health facility in Awka speaking on his findings on the COVID-19 and the stages the new invention went through and it’s composition said, “Let me tell you, this COVID-19 is like every other viral disease, except with slight difference. Once a virus enters your body, all the soldiers of the body will rush to it to attack it, and while they are battling the virus, they leave other ailment in the body, giving those ones the opportunity to thrive. That is why it is more dangerous for people who have underlying ailment.\\n\\n“So, what we did in the invention of this drug is to ensure that we lace it with solution to other diseases that are common among aged persons. While we are treating for the virus, other health conditions would also be benefiting from the treatment, and in that case, both the virus and other ailment in the body are tackled simultaneously.”\\n\\nOn the cost of the drug, he said, “Our drugs are usually very cheap. That is why you see that we do not have sophisticated packaging, which is one of the things that make products expensive.”\\n\",\n  \"createdAt\": \"2020-07-02T08:28:40.445Z\",\n  \"creatorId\": \"UbDb4ITEdd-J\"\n}, {\n  \"_id\": \"xjl9L6_kY71ZJJsLPSpA-\",\n  \"image_link\": \"https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftse2.mm.bing.net%2Fth%3Fid%3DOIP.1EFC7A_wwjjPwZcqVyieFwEsDh%26pid%3DApi&f=1\",\n  \"caption\": \"Pharmacists Threaten Nationwide Strike over FG’s Unwillingness to Meet Demands\",\n  \"author\": \"\",\n  \"source\": \"ThisDay\",\n  \"source_link\": \"https://www.thisdaylive.com/index.php/2020/06/18/investment-in-iycf-nigerias-untapped-smart-development-plan/\",\n  \"category\": \"health\",\n  \"headings\": \"not\",\n  \"abstract_cat\": \"none\",\n  \"content\": \"The Association of Hospital and Administrative Pharmacists of Nigeria (AHAPN) has threatened to embark on a nationwide strike action over what it termed federal government’s unwillingness to accede to its demands.\\n\\nAHAPN is the umbrella body of pharmacists practicing in hospitals, clinics, Federal Ministry of Health (FMOH), and health agencies, among others, with over 5,000 members in the country.\\n\\n\\n \\nIn a statement made available to THISDAY Thursday and signed by the National Chairman, AHAPN, Dr. Kingsley Chiedu Amibor, the body said some of its demands include restructuring of the health sector, adjustment of the Consolidated Health Salary Structure (CONHESS), pay COVID-19 hazard allowance, provide personal protective equipment (PPE) for pharmacists and other healthcare workers, as well as payment of April and May 2018 salary arrears for pharmacists and some category of healthcare workers.\\n\\nAmibor said: “The federal government in 2014 adjusted the Consolidated Medica Salary Scheme (CONMESS) table for medical doctors and has since adjusted it twice without a single adjustment to CONHESS table for pharmacists and other healthcare professionals.\\n\\n“It is worthy of note that in 2008, there was a job evaluation in the healthcare sector which gave rise to CONHESS and CONMESS, taking into cognizance, relativity in salary and allowances; a recommendation that was intended to reduce the level of acrimony in the healthcare sector. Sadly, this recommendation was partially adopted with the adjustments to CONMESS without relative adjustment of CONHESS.”\\n\\nHe said government should immediate adjust CONHESS as has been continuously canvassed by pharmacists and other healthcare workers, in order to avoid needless strike actions and disruptions in service delivery in the healthcare sector.\\n\\nAmibor said: “Virtually every other healthcare professional with the exception of very few and pharmacists who practice in about 20 federal health institutions have not been paid the arrears to date. We have written several letters to government on this issue without any positive response yet.\\n\\n“We call upon government to release these arrears since it was captured in the 2020 Budget and provisions have been made for it. We call on government to provide adequate PPEs for pharmacists and other healthcare workers who are at the front line of the COVID-19 pandemic control efforts.\\n\\n“Additionally, we wish to remind government to honour her decision to pay enhanced hazard allowance to healthcare workers since March, 2020. This pronouncement has not translated into tangible result yet.”\\n\\nHe also said government’s refusal to register AHANP as a trade union was unfortunate, adding that it has applied severally to no avail.\\n\\n“About 2001, we were granted provisional registration as a trade union by the Federal Ministry of Labour and Productivity, but for some inexplicable reasons, our registration was withdrawn. All efforts by AHANP to get full registration since then proved abortive.”\\n\\nHe said the association was also using the opportunity to register it’s displeasure over non-inclusion of pharmacists at the recent meeting between the government and representatives of the different unions in the healthcare sector.\\n\\nDescibing the action as distasteful, he called on the federal government to urgently address the issues raised, as its unwillingness would mean the association would have no choice than to press home their demands through industrial action.\\n\",\n  \"createdAt\": \"2020-07-02T08:26:52.722Z\",\n  \"creatorId\": \"UbDb4ITEdd-J\"\n}, {\n  \"_id\": \"dJ0H9Hg5QYf0zOeDN2y5M\",\n  \"image_link\": \"https://storage.googleapis.com/thisday-846548948316-wp-data/wp-media/2020/07/e1119786-alash-le-abimiku-696x522.jpg\",\n  \"caption\": \"https://storage.googleapis.com/thisday-846548948316-wp-data/wp-media/2018/09/97bf2d41-mother-and-child-696x522.jpg\",\n  \"author\": \"\",\n  \"source\": \"ThisDay\",\n  \"source_link\": \"https://www.thisdaylive.com/index.php/2020/06/18/investment-in-iycf-nigerias-untapped-smart-development-plan/\",\n  \"category\": \"health\",\n  \"headings\": \"not\",\n  \"abstract_cat\": \"none\",\n  \"content\": \"Global experts have stressed that investment in infant and young child feeding does not only improve the health and nutrition of children, but aids human capital development. Martins Ifijeh writes on the need for Nigeria to take advantage of this to address gaps in human and economic development in the country\\n\\nDuring the 2019 International Monetary Fund (IMF) Spring Meeting held in Washington DC, United States in April, world leaders raised alarm over growth challenge by the global economy, stressing that Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was in fast decline in many countries of the world, including Nigeria where the 2.10 per cent reported for Q1 2019 declined to 1.94 per cent in Q2 2019; amounting to -0.16 per cent drop.\\n\\nBut to address this, the Managing Director of IMF, Christine Lagarde was quick to call on countries to make smart investment plans. She believed investments in the ‘small boats’ were some of the smartest ways to economic prosperity with high return on investment assured. To her, investment in ‘small boats’ means investment in the poor and middle class.\\n\\n\\n \\nInvestment in Human Capital Development Low in Nigeria\\nAmong countries most affected by the lack of investment in ‘small boats’ is Nigeria. Its human capital development index is still at the lowest ebb when priority areas of the government are examined. The country channels high budgetary allocations to infrastructural development far more than human capital. In the 2020 National Budget, Power and Transportation take lion share of the allocations.\\n\\nOn specifics, the indices from the two areas used in accessing human capital development; health and education, showed that the country is still worse off. For instance, Nigeria has the second highest under-five death indices globally, and currently has the highest number of out of school children in the world; a figure, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) has put at 10.5 million children.\\n\\nInvest in Nutrition to Grow Economy\\nThe immediate past Chairman, Nigeria’s Senate Committee on Health, Senator Lanre Tejuoso, also at the Spring Meeting in Washington DC, mentioned that one of the smartest moves by Nigeria will be to invest in the nutrition of children, adding that its return on investment of one dollar equals 16 dollars and would in no small measure take the country out of poverty on the long run.\\n\\nAccording to him, investment in nutrition will not only improve the health of infants and young children, but will play a major role in how much these children will do well in school, in career as adults, generally on human development, as well as change the country’s economic index positively, overtime.\\nHe said: “The impact that will come from investing in the nutrition of children of under five in Nigeria cannot be ignored, especially since these children will later in life run the economy, as this investment now will determine if they ca successfully run the economy or bring it aground.”\\n\\nOn the reverse, poor nutrition has been shown to impede cognitive and physical development, which translates to decreased learning ability, reduced productivity in adult years, increased healthcare costs, and generally leads to poverty.\\n\\nAfrican countries lose an average of eight per cent of their annual GDP due to malnutrition. Micronutrient deficiencies alone result in a 1.5 billion dollars loss in Nigeria each year, according to the Nutrition Society of Nigeria.\\n\\nOn the flipside, every dollar invested in nutrition in Nigeria has an average return of nearly 16 dollars. These figures leave little doubt of the economic potential of nutrition. If the country is to compete in the global economy and supercharge the potential demographic dividend, it will need to ensure its children are well nourished.\\n\\nScaling up such proven interventions could help Nigeria reach the World Health Assembly (WHA) target of reducing stunting by 40 per cent by 2025 and adding 29 billion dollars to the Nigerian economy.\\n\\nThe Sorry State of Nigeria’s Malnutrition\\nAccording to the Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey, Nigeria has the second highest number of malnourished children in the world, just second to India, and way ahead of Somalia, Syria and other war-torn countries, as well as those with weaker economic strength.\\nThe survey also showed that Nigeria has the highest number of stunted children under age five in sub-Sahara Africa with 37 per cent of all children stunted, 18 per cent wasted, while 29 per cent are underweight, thereby making malnutrition the factor responsible for more than 50 per cent of under-five mortality in Nigeria.\\nIt is this sorry state that Senator Tejuoso described as a timebomb waiting to happen if the country’s levels of government refuse to scale up nutrition intervention across board.\\n\\nImproving Nutrition through IYCF Programme\\n\\nThe United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) said one of the effective programmes in addressing nutrition issues in the country is through the Infant and Young Child Feeding and programmes associated with it, which the Nigerian government and all state governments of the federation have signed on to.\\n\\nIt says promoting evidence-based IYCF, including exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life, feeding a diverse diet of nutritious foods and breastmilk from six to 23 months of life, feeding malnourished children with specialised food regime, were some of the interventions needed in addressing malnutrition in the country.\\n\\nCarrying out IYCF programme involves facility-based IYCF counselling for pregnant women and mothers with infants less than two years of age, facilitated by health workers; community-based IYCF counselling for pregnant women and mothers with infant less than two years of age, facilitated by community volunteers; and community-based meetings with fathers of infants less than two years of age and grandmothers, facilitated by community volunteers. If this is adequately funded and implemented to the letter, it is believed it will help in reducing the malnutrition burden in the country.\\n\\nEffect of Nutrition Investment to Infants and Young Children\\n\\nResearch has shown that women who get adequate nutrition during pregnancy, give exclusive breastfeeding to their new born for six months, as well as ensure adequate feeding until their baby clocks 1000 days of life, are more likely to have children who will do well in school, have healthier living, and are able to face the rigours of adulthood, while becoming assets to their immediate society and the nation at large.\\n\\nA study by the American Society of Nutrition has established a link between adequate nutrition before a child’s fifth birthday and the child’s high intelligent quotient.\\nThe study also says a well-nourished under-five year old child would develop a high cognitive prowess and physical capacity to add to a country’s GDP through proper learning and decision-making abilities, while a malnourished child may grow up to become suboptimal adult with under-performing economic abilities later in life.\\nA report by Orphan Nutrition, a humanitarian organisation showed that a deficiency in one nutrient may lead to a deficiency in another nutrient.\\n\\nFor example, deficiency in iron, magnesium and zinc can cause anorexia and thereby result in reduced intake of other important nutrients such as protein. Low lipid intake can also affect the absorption of important fat-soluble vitamins such as vitamins A and D. It also showed that zinc and protein deficiencies can retard bone growth and development, putting a child at risk for long-term complications.\\n\\nLack of Political Will, Major Hurdles to Investment\\n\\nWhile most political leaders, no doubt, believe in providing democratic dividends to their societies, they often prefer to invest in areas with tangible (physical) concerns, like building roads, schools and bridging, and donating sewing machines, among others, whereas investment in nutrition suffers because the immediate impact may not be visible to their electorates whom they plan to meet for validation of their re-election bid or general acceptance in the society.\\n\\nPush for Government Intervention\\n\\nWith various researches showing that investments in infant and young child feeding can turn around the economic fortune of any society, it is a no brainer for any government, whether, federal, state or local, which truly hopes to improve the quality of life of its people, not to give priority budget allocation to nutrition of its young ones.\\n\\nThe Convention on the Rights of the Child which Nigeria signed into, recognizes the right of the child to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health. The right also ensures government takes appropriate measures to, among other things: reduce infant and child mortality, combat disease and malnutrition, among others.\\n\\nWhile the federal government in 2016 budgeted a surprising, yet embarrassing N2 million for nutrition in the entire country, it however improved in 2017 to N1.2 billion, even though only about half of the figure was actually released. Almost same figures have been released since the last two years without significant increase, even though it says it hopes to become one of the strongest economies by 2030, if the Economic and Growth Recovery Plan (EGRP) of the federal government is to go by.\\n\\nSame lack of will has been seen among states who pay little attention to the nutrition of its under-five, while other sectors, with less bearing on the human capital development gets centre stage.\\n\\nIs the country ready to make smart investments to improve its economy? Time will tell.\",\n  \"createdAt\": \"2020-07-02T08:23:55.465Z\",\n  \"creatorId\": \"UbDb4ITEdd-J\"\n}, {\n  \"_id\": \"jaxJ3SJ26l2cVuNVlQDJe\",\n  \"image_link\": \"https://storage.googleapis.com/thisday-846548948316-wp-data/wp-media/2020/07/e1119786-alash-le-abimiku-696x522.jpg\",\n  \"caption\": \"Abimiku: With Investment in Research, Health Infrastructure, Citizen-support, Nigeria Will Defeat COVID-19\",\n  \"author\": \"\",\n  \"source\": \"ThisDay\",\n  \"source_link\": \"https://www.thisdaylive.com/index.php/2020/07/02/abimiku-with-investment-in-research-health-infrastructure-citizen-support-nigeria-will-defeat-covid-19/\",\n  \"category\": \"health\",\n  \"headings\": \"not\",\n  \"abstract_cat\": \"latest_news\",\n  \"content\": \"Alash’le Abimiku is a Professor of Medicine at the University of Maryland, United States, and the Executive Director, International Research for Human Virology Nigeria. In this interview with Martins Ifijeh, she said fundamental investment in research, support from citizens, and establishment of health infrastructure can help Nigeria tackle the COVID-19 pandemic. She spoke on how the body has initiated ideas to support government’s efforts against the outbreak, and how long term approach will ensure the country is better equipped for future outbreaks\\n\\nWhat factors lead to drug resistant TB and why are cases rising during the COVID-19 pandemic?\\nWe know from long ago; tuberculosis is a bacterium. We know that when you expose bacterium to a drug for a limited period of time it also tries to survive by also building resistance. With resistance, there is a mutation within the bacteria’s gene that makes it now possible for it not to be susceptible to a particular drug. Historically, when a bacterium, in this case, mycobacterium tuberculosis is exposed for a period of time to drugs, it will develop a mechanism to continue to exist despite the drugs, hence, you see the resistance. You start with mono- resistance, resistance to one drug and then you see that as we move through treatment, people are treated with multiple drugs so that if the microorganism is resistant to one, the second would work. It takes some time for those microorganisms to develop resistance to those additional drugs, then you continue to add.\\n\\nYour second question is about COVID-19 and the fact that the numbers are increasing. Remember that we learn a lot from countries that are experiencing this pandemic. When you have your index case, you identify all those people that have come in contact with the index case to make sure that you limit the spread of the virus.\\n\\n\\n \\nUnfortunately, unless your prevention method is airtight and every citizen does what they are supposed to do, the virus will escape into the community. The moment it escapes into the community, each person interacts with additional individuals, and then it is expected that the cases will rise. It is not unusual, it happened in China, it happened in Spain, it is still happening in the US and in Italy. So we expect it to rise the moment it gets into the community, and that is why every single prevention method in terms of distancing, using soap and water, using sanitizer and using the face mask is absolutely critical for each and every person to do because our strength really depends on our weakest link. So, if we all, 90 percent of us are doing the right thing and 10 per cent are not doing it, we won’t get rid of COVID-19.\\n\\nA month ago, you told THISDAY IHVN reached out to the federal government concerning your efforts at COVID-19 researches and other supports. Have you gotten feedback from the government?\\nNo, not really, what we have done is we have submitted about five different proposals addressing different aspects of COVID-19 and one has to do with evaluation of the different devices within our population to see how well it works, how we can identify those who are infected, maybe also be able to identify, those that have built up immune responses and also be able to define the clinical symptoms within our population. We have submitted that. We had that the task force on research is considering one of the proposals that we put in to evaluate the different devices for testing COVID-19, one that you can use within very well established infrastructure and facility like IHVN or tertiary hospitals and those that you can use in rural areas where you don’t have dependable electricity. So, we heard that that is being reviewed, although no word yet whether it has been chosen. We have not also gotten any funding to continue that line of research\\n\\nAre you of the opinion many Nigerians do not believe there is COVID-19?\\nI guess it is expected. Actually, people do know a bit about coronavirus in the sense that we have had some other outbreaks before epidemics like this. The SARS and the MERS happened in the Middle East and some in China.\\nEpidemics mean that it is limited to certain parts of the geographical region. This is the first time we have had a coronavirus that has hit everywhere in the world and that is why it is called a pandemic. So I think the reason why everybody knows about coronavirus now is because it has really hit home and it has hit every single country and there is no day you put on the TV or the papers that you don’t read about it. I mean media outlets like yours have also educated the people.\\n\\nIf you remember HIV, we never knew about it until it hit and started killing people. In a similar vein, that is what has happened with the coronavirus. It belongs to the same corona virus family, this COVID-19 and the only difference is that this one is quite novel so all populations over the world have not seen it so everybody is susceptible, we don’t have any prior immunity to it. That is why all of the populations all over the world were very susceptible to it and you heard about the different routes of transmission that makes all our interactions as human beings a potential for transmitting the virus. So I believe that because of the overwhelming spread of the virus all over the world, because of the way that it has affected our interactions with each other, the way that it has affected our ability to move within homes, to the office, to travel out, it is really a significant media topic.\\nIs it possible to teach coronavirus and the pandemic in schools, putting into consideration the philosophy of our educational system.\\n\\nThat may be a very good idea. One of the things that we have done as a nation or as a population and we haven’t done a good job with is that we do not anticipate. When we had the pandemic flu, H1M, SARS, and when we had all of those things, it was very clear for the public health individual that this will continue to be a public health challenge, because it wasn’t a matter of if, but when it is going to happen again. So, I think they should be taught in schools. We haven’t done a good job in teaching public health.\\n\\nPreparedness is the one thing you can do to prevent any virus spread because viruses by nature are not that sensitive to drugs. We have a lot of antibiotics and drugs that you can take but it is mostly against parasites and bacteria. Viruses are really based on our human nature so sometimes when you have a pandemic, it is because it has jumped across species to a new one.\\n\\nIn school, we should focus on public health threats and preparedness. When Ebola came, we were having temporary fix; forgetting that isolation units, protective gear, having the laboratories that can do the tests would also work perfectly for corona but you see, when we do things as if they are temporary fix. If we don’t establish it in school, in our government, in our facilities, then we are never prepared. This is here and would stay with us as long as man lives and continues to interact. We would always have those kinds of outbreaks. It’s not rocket science; it just needs commitment in terms of our policy makers and our educational system to really keep that in the forefront of our response.\\n\\nAppears the federal government is silent on vaccines and treatment drugs for COVID-19, as it is believed no fund has been released yet for this. Are there other ways we can come up with vaccines and drugs outside getting funding from government?\\nThe point you brought up is a good one. That is why IHVN existence is based on obtaining funds and getting grants to do the work, but that does not exonerate the government from investing in research. If you look at other countries, they prepare for epidemics. These countries work for years in building infrastructures and capacity in this area.\\nThe National Institute for Pharmaceutical Research and Development (NIPRD) was successful some time ago in getting drugs, so the bottom line is there are some fundamental infrastructure and investment that government must make first and foremost whether through the International Monetary Fund (IMF) or through the World Bank, the Dangotes or through Gates. There are fundamental investments they need to do that no one grant can do.\\n\\nOnce they do that fundamental investment in research, build the infrastructure and the machinery and everything that will allow your scientist to do the work; then your scientist can now apply for grants that allows them get the reagents and to follow their ideas. There has to be that prior investment and it has to be long-term.\\n\\nThe second thing I will say quickly is that also, each nation must know its capacity. Don’t go and start competing with the western world on putting together a vaccine. The western world has a lot more infrastructure and has a lot more funding. They’ve been doing it for years. Then, you suddenly wake up one night and think that you are going to compete with vaccines, you will not. Find the areas that you are strong in.\\n\\nOne of the things that we know we have, for sure, are local herbs and different activities that we do, that we know that there may be something that we can contribute to the rest of the world, like Madagascar did. Let’s put our money in there, like NIPRD and other organisations, it’s all collaboration. There is no one institution that can do it. Government has to be very clever in how it uses its limited resources and its limited infrastructure in what is it that is unique that we can go in and compete intelligently with the rest of the world and contribute to the answers.\\n\\nCan’t Nigeria look towards using local herbs to address this COVID-19, rather than looking out for herbs from Madagascar and other places?\\nJust quickly to tell you that I know for a fact this is one of the areas being considered. I am member of a scientific advisory committee for NIPRD and in fact, in addition to looking at claims internationally and locally, this is being looked at. Again, my concern is the fact that what are we doing until these things happen? We got institutions that their main goal is really to look at things like that. I don’t want to be all negative because to be quite honest there has been some advances in this area where different herbal concoctions within the country have been better refined and they are available in packets and all of that but I always worry that we are too reactive.\",\n  \"createdAt\": \"2020-07-02T07:55:39.660Z\",\n  \"creatorId\": \"UbDb4ITEdd-J\"\n}, {\n  \"_id\": \"ukcC5cjzx4g8gSIcwjqxL\",\n  \"image_link\": \"https://storage.googleapis.com/thisday-846548948316-wp-data/wp-media/2020/07/d9e7bad6-mecure-logo-696x522.jpg\",\n  \"caption\": \"MeCure Launches Online Consultations, Plans to Bring 10,000 Doctors Online\",\n  \"author\": \"\",\n  \"source\": \"ThisDay\",\n  \"source_link\": \"https://www.thisdaylive.com/index.php/2020/07/02/disinfection-solution-against-viruses-bacteria-fungi-debuts-in-nigeria/\",\n  \"category\": \"health\",\n  \"headings\": \"not\",\n  \"abstract_cat\": \"top_stories\",\n  \"content\": \"As the world continue to battle the COVID-19 pandemic, MeCure Smart has launched an online consultation platform with the aim of bring 10,000 doctors to virtual interaction with patients to minimise physical and social contacts.\\n\\nThe Product Manager, Mecure Smarts, Mr. Ajinkya Shelar ina statement made available to THISDAY recently, said the firm has launched the its smartphone app (msb.ng) that allows remote online consultations which is tied up to with HelloDocApp, the largest online community of doctors in Nigeria.\\n\\n\\n \\nHe said: “When we launched MeCure Smart back in April 2019, we were simply conducting an experiment: Is the Nigerian market ready for healthcare services through a digital platform.\\n\\n“Cut to February 2020 and we were not able to handle the sheer volume of calls anymore.

And I believe that the PDP is standing a good chance to take over”.\\n\\nJegede, who was the governorship candidate of the PDP in the 2016 election hinged his optimism on the alleged dismal performance and dwindling popularity of the APC in the state.\\n\\nJegede described the defection of the Deputy Governor of the state, Hon Agboola Ajayi as a welcome development that would further weakened the chances of the APC in the election.\\n\\n“There is no cause for alarm. If APC is a good party, the gentleman would not leave the party and if he has good chances in APC, he would not have left the party. I am not afraid of competition”.\\n\\nHe noted that since 2016 the PDP in Ondo State has grown to become a formidable party and united to defeat the APC and provide better governance for the people of the state.\\n\\nHe noted that in 2019 general election, the PDP got more votes in the presidential election than the APC and got two senates.\\n\\nHe said, “Before 2019, APC had all the three Senators, but in 2019, they lost two to the PDP. Secondly, in 2015, APC had highest votes in the presidential election but in 2019 PDP scored majority of votes despite the fact that APC was in government both at the federal and state level. Ondo State was the only state in the South West that recorded margin of votes for the PDP. It is my privilege to lead as the Director General (DG) of Atiku campaign organization in the state when we achieved this feat.”\\n\\nHe said he has gathered enough experience not to allow what happened to him in 2016 when “his hands were tied to his legs” by some party members only to be loosened two days to the election by the court.\",\n  \"createdAt\": \"2020-07-02T07:47:15.810Z\",\n  \"creatorId\": \"UbDb4ITEdd-J\"\n}, {\n  \"_id\": \"1nMS9iM_von1yLFV64dP2\",\n  \"image_link\": \"https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Mr.-Muhammad-Rudman.jpg\",\n  \"caption\": \"Nigeria saves N15 billion through IXP, as Internet traffic goes local\",\n  \"author\": \"\",\n  \"source\": \"Guardian\",\n  \"source_link\": \"https://guardian.ng/technology/nigeria-saves-n15-billion-through-ixp-as-internet-traffic-goes-local/\",\n  \"category\": \"tech_inno\",\n  \"headings\": \"not\",\n  \"abstract_cat\": \"none\",\n  \"content\": \"With the aid of the Internet Exchange Point of Nigeria (IXPN), Nigeria is said to have saved about $40 million (N15.2 billion) in the localisation of Internet traffic, which would have gone abroad.\\n\\nThe N15 billion savings, as explained by the Internet Society (ISOC), was achieved when the IXPN grew from carrying just 300 Megabits per second (Mbps) to peak traffic of 125 Gbps in 2020.\\n\\nAccording to ISOC in its study, titled: “Anchoring the African Internet Ecosystem: Lessons from Kenya and Nigeria’s Internet Exchange Points Growth”, IXPN achieved a milestone in its efforts to ensure that Internet services providers in the country exchanged their traffic locally by exchanging 125 Gbps traffic in 2020.\\n\\nThe latest report was an update on a study published by the ISOC in 2012, which examined two of Africa’s more advanced IXPs at the time – KIXP in Kenya, and IXPN in Nigeria.\\n\\nThe growth recorded by IXPN, according to the report has put Nigeria in a better position than ever before to cope with and contribute to the digital revolution that COVID-19 has accelerated, with Internet becoming a lifeline for many people.\\n\\nSenior Director, Internet Technology and Development for the Internet Society, Michuki Mwangi, said: “It’s clear Africa is ready to embrace the digital revolution to spur economic development. But reaching this goal will depends on our community of passionate people on the ground, policymakers, regulators and businesses embracing IXPs and working in collaboration to create these essential local traffic anchors,”\\n\\nThe report commended Nigerian government for not only making it easier for different service providers to develop sub-marine cables, but also adopted data protection regulations that spurred confidence and attracted international service providers.\\n\\nAnalysing the report with The Guardian, the Chief Executive Officer, IXPN, Muhammed Rudman, said the report is a testament to the good happenings in Africa, especially in Nigeria, as it captured the country’s growth and the impact made in the last eight years.\\n\\n“The over 400 fold in growth of local traffic is significant, which translates to about 70 per cent traffic for most of the service providers connected to IXPN. We hope to sustain this trajectory and to provide similar services to other regions within the country,” he stated.\\n\\nRudman further said the feat was achieved because the IXP was able to attract content providers, especially the big players such as Google, and Facebook. He said the establishment of more data centres in Nigeria also aided the growth.\\n\\nAccording to him, the realization that Nigerian companies needed to host their data locally, which hitherto they routed abroad also contributed significantly. He added that the fibre link interconnection, which ensured the connection of all the exchanges in the country also made things easier.\\n\\n“A lot of Nigerians are now hosting their servers locally, and we have attracted some of the big players in Internet content into the country, such as Google, Facebook and Alkamire, and presently we are trying to bring other bigger ones to the country,” he stated.\\n\\nHe urged smaller Internet service providers (ISPs) to connect to the IXPN in order to widely peer with other members and increase the efficiency of their interconnections, disclosing that IXPN covers eight Point of Presence (POP) across Nigeria.\\n\\nTo improve on the growth, the IXPN CEO, appealed to the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) to ensure the compliance with the Local Content Guidelines; ensure that all government’s websites, and emails are hosted in Nigeria.\\n\\nRudman said educational institutions should also be encouraged to host in some of the data centres in the country.\\n\\nIXPN Point of Presence (POP) in Nigeria includes four in Lagos and one each in Abuja, Port Harcourt, Enugu and Kano. The Lagos POP connects both to each other and to the POP in the other four cities in an effort to extend connectivity to the unserved and underserved,” he said.\\n\\nIXPN in 2015 emerged as a regional exchange for West Africa with the support of the African Union Commission; which is aimed at reducing the latency and save costs by eliminating international transit through overseas carriers.\\n\",\n  \"createdAt\": \"2020-07-01T13:01:23.249Z\",\n  \"creatorId\": \"UbDb4ITEdd-J\"\n}, {\n  \"_id\": \"7-Ueq1K-K_50afcMvF5VT\",\n  \"image_link\": \"https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Ferdie-Moolman.jpg\",\n  \"caption\": \"Operators donate kits, offer free SMS in COVID-19 fight\",\n  \"author\": \"\",\n  \"source\": \"Guardian\",\n  \"source_link\": \"https://guardian.ng/technology/operators-donate-kits-offer-free-sms-in-covid-19-fight/\",\n  \"category\": \"tech_inno\",\n  \"headings\": \"not\",\n  \"abstract_cat\": \"top_stories\",\n  \"content\": \"Two players in Nigeria’s information and communications technology (ICT) sector have further donated equipment kits and services to the government in the fight against COVID-19.

But, analysts believe that his positive contributions to the industry outweigh the downside of his first five years as the chief executive officer of NCC.\\n\\nIt is on this premise that the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Pantami, who recommended Danbatta to President Muhammadu Buhari for a second term, called on the EVC and his team to redouble their efforts towards actualising the digital economy agenda of the Federal Government.\\n\\nThe Minister spoke when the Executive Management of the Commission led by Danbatta paid him a courtesy visit on Monday.\\n\\nAccording to the Minister, the proactive decision to recommend Danbatta’s reappointment to the President for approval was “to ensure stability in the telecommunications industry and consolidate on the gains and successes already recorded in the industry in the last five years of Danbatta’s leadership as the EVC of NCC.”\\n\\nPantami, however, emphasised the need for the Danbatta-led NCC Management to work more harmoniously with the Ministry and agencies, towards ensuring effective implementation of the National Digital Economy Policy and Strategy (NDEPS) as well as thorough implementation of the new National Broadband Plan (NBP), 2020-2025.\\n\\n“The success of the Commission is our collective responsibility.

But today, it has grown to over $70 billion. Despite this, the telecom regulator has admitted the present investment in the sector is inadequate and will continue to pursue policies that would encourage more investment, stressing that Nigeria is one of the fastest growing telecommunications markets in the world.\\n\\nSpeaking at the maiden Nigerian Telecom Leadership Summit (NTLS) held in Lagos last year (2019), Danbatta, admitted: “The volume of telecom investment in Nigeria is very impressive and indicative of a very fast-growing and resilient sector of the economy. But, we will continue to advocate for more investment, giving that the industry was very capital intensive, with the competition for Foreign Direct Investments becoming fiercer among different nations.”\\n\\nIt is estimated that about 40 million Nigerians, especially those in the rural and semi-urban areas are yet to be reached with basic infrastructure and services, making the over $68 billion investment in the telecom industry inadequate and therefore committed to attracting more investment in the industry.\\n\\nStressing this during the NTLS, Danbatta stated: “The argument for more investments becomes more compelling, given that this industry is very capital intensive, with the competition for Foreign Direct Investments, FDls, becoming fiercer among different nations. In our consultative regulatory process, we consider shared experiences, and shared vision as the best approach to equip us with the tools to continuously reposition towards the course of effective regulation.”\\n\\nCurbing Menace of Call Masking, Call Refilling\\nIn the wake of 2017, the menace of call masking/call refilling and SIM boxing reared their ugly heads with a charge on NCC to find a lasting solution to the menace.\\n\\nBasically, call masking is when inbound international calls terminate in Nigeria as local number.\\n\\nThis raises security concerns, competition issue and portends negative economic implications. In fact, it is estimated that globally, call masking is causing economy $60 billion yearly.\\n\\nNCC, under Danbatta, tackled the menace by ensuring strict compliance monitoring and enforcement by the Commission; imposition of appropriate sanctions by NCC on licensees involved in call refiling and masking activities; and suspension of numbering plans of some perpetrators and withdrawal of all their inactive numbering plans.\\n\\nThese interventions generated results for the industry. First, call masking (otherwise called call line identity (CLI) spoofing) has since dropped to more than 40 per cent compared to how prevalent it as in January 2018. Also, SIM boxing traffic has been down by about\\n25 per cent as at September 11, 2018.\\n\\nWidening broadband deployment and spectrum auction\\nFollowing the implementation of the 8-Point Agenda, the country was able to achieve and surpass its broadband penetration target of 30 per cent by the end of December, 2018, a feat that got commendations.\\n\\nVarious efforts of the Commission in licensing new spectrum bands, re-farming certain frequency bands and driving initiatives for increased broadband infrastructure in the country have also been responsible for these feats.\\n\\nWith increase in broadband penetration being recorded on a monthly basis, stakeholders have said that the NCC is well positioned and must be supported by the government through relevant policies to drive the actualisation of the country’s digital economy policy strategy, going forward.\\n\\nThis has become necessary since, as usual; the Commission is expected to take the driver’s seat in the actualisation of the new broadband target being worked on by the Ministry of Communication and Digital Economy. Just recently, the new National Broadband Plan for 2020-2025 was unveiled by President Muhammadu Buhari. This targets 70 per cent broadband penetration in the next five years.\\n\\nDanbatta made it clear that henceforth, access to broadband, which stands at 39.5 per cent, will become a fundamental metrics for measuring development growth and development in Nigeria, as it will be central to the growth recorded in every other sector of the economy where telecoms would be driving services automation and digitisation.\\n\\nAlready, six Infrastructure Companies (InfraCos) have been licensed by NCC to take broadband in an Open Access Model to the 774 Local Government Areas of the country.\\n\\n\\nNigeria saves N15 billion through IXP, as Internet traffic goes local\\n8 hours ago\\nLagos tasks youths on tech talent development, graduates 18\\n8 hours ago\\nGlobal eWaste sees 21% rise as Africa generates 2.9 metric tones\\n8 hours ago\\n\\nExecutive Commissioner, Stakeholders Management, Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), Adeleke Adewolu (left); Executive Vice Chairman/CEO,NCC, Prof. Umar Garba Danbatta; Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr. Isa Ali Ibrahim Pantami, and Executive Commissioner, Technical Services, NCC, Ubale Maska, during a Courtesy visit to the Minister, Abuja, on Monday.\\n\\nAs the saying goes, the reward for hard work is more work.

They stressed that governments around the world are transforming and adapting to this change, hence Nigeria is not exceptional.\\n\\nCountry Manager, Microsoft Nigeria, Akin Banuso, said Microsoft has presented digital transformation as a means for social and economic development in Nigeria, and as an opportunity for every Nigerian citizen and business to achieve more.\\n\\nBanuso said Just as there is an effective commercial ecosystem that brings the promise of technology to life in the marketplace, there must also be a strong societal ecosystem that democratises the promise of technology. Pantami in his paper noted that Nigeria is not only a key player in West Africa but is also the continent’s largest economy.\\n\\n“The country has historically been dependent on its oil resources and the revenue received from it as a means for development and growth, making it highly susceptible to the volatility of oil prices. There is massive potential for growth through the digital economy for Nigeria.”\\n\\n“This forward-looking whitepaper from Microsoft aligns with the eight pillars contained in the National Digital Economy Policy and Strategy and the country’s Economic Recovery and Growth Plan and so will support the country in collaborating towards building an inclusive Digital Nigeria,” Pantami added.\\n\\nGovernment Affairs Director for Microsoft Emerging Markets, Rimini Makama, in a statement, said: “Technology is at the heart of driving a digital economy which will bring these priorities to fruition. The question for Law makers and policymakers around the world is how to harness the power of the technology to transform people’s lives for the better without unleashing the potential for dislocation and disorder.”\",\n  \"createdAt\": \"2020-07-01T12:51:05.593Z\",\n  \"creatorId\": \"UbDb4ITEdd-J\"\n}, {\n  \"_id\": \"NKlAb0hCzsK-44_GwSCb0\",\n  \"image_link\": \"https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftse4.mm.bing.net%2Fth%3Fid%3DOIP.WMp0qA6SLFj945Fj4Jp1HgAAAA%26pid%3DApi&f=1\",\n  \"caption\": \" COVID-19 spikes SMS traffic as customers send over one billion in a month\",\n  \"author\": \"\",\n  \"source\": \"Guardian\",\n  \"source_link\": \"https://guardian.ng/technology/covid-19-spikes-sms-traffic-as-customers-send-over-one-billion-in-a-month/\",\n  \"category\": \"tech_inno\",\n  \"headings\": \"not\",\n  \"abstract_cat\": \"none\",\n  \"content\": \"\\nRising COVID-19 cases may induce more hardships, FG warns\\n8 hours ago\\nSchools resumption faces new hurdles\\n8 hours ago\\nPeyton Manker ductape dressTeenager Creates Masterpiece Prom Dress Out Of 41 Rolls of Duct Tape\\n4 hours ago\\nLockdown triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic has increased the usage of short message service (SMS) in the country, as subscribers were discovered to have sent over one billion within a month\\n\\nThough, they were largely free, checks on some of the operators revealed the rate of how customers made use of the SMS platform to send messages across to one another.\\n\\nFor instance, a check on MTN, showed that within five weeks of the lockdown, which made people to work remotely, over one billion free text messages were sent by customers within the first four weeks of introducing the offer!

This makes e-waste the world’s fastest-growing domestic waste stream, fueled mainly by higher consumption rates of electric and electronic equipment, short life cycles, and few options for repair.\\n\\nAccording to UN, only 17.4 per cent of 2019’s e-waste was collected and recycled. This means that gold, silver, copper, platinum and other high-value, recoverable materials conservatively valued at $57 billion — a sum greater than the gross domestic product of most countries – were mostly dumped or burned rather than being collected for treatment and reuse.\\n\\nAccording to the report, Asia generated the greatest volume of e-waste in 2019 — about 24.9 Mt, followed by the Americas (13.1 Mt) and Europe (12 Mt), while Africa and Oceania generated 2.9 Mt and 0.7 Mt, respectively.\\n\\nFor perspective, last year’s e-waste weighed substantially more than all the adults in Europe, or as much as 350 cruise ships the size of the Queen Mary 2, enough to form a line 125 km long.\\n\\nE-waste is a health and environmental hazard, containing toxic additives or hazardous substances such as mercury, which damages the human brain and / or coordination system.\\n\\nOther key findings from the Global E-waste Monitor 2020 include that proper e-waste management can help mitigate global warming. In 2019, an estimated 98 Mt of CO2-equivalents were released into the atmosphere from discarded fridges and air-conditioners, contributing roughly 0.3 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions.\\n\\nIn per capita terms, last year’s discarded e-waste averaged 7.3 kg for every man, woman and child on Earth.\\n\\nIt further revealed that Europe ranked first worldwide in terms of e-waste generation per capita with 16.2 kg per capita. Oceania came second (16.1 kg) followed by the Americas (13.3 kg). Asia and Africa were much lower: 5.6 and 2.5 kg respectively.\\n\\nAccording to UN, eWaste remains a health and environmental hazard, containing toxic additives or hazardous substances such as mercury, which damages the human brain and / or coordination system. An estimated 50 tonnes of mercury — used in monitors, PCBs and fluorescent and energy-saving light sources — are contained in undocumented flows of e-waste annually.\\n\\nThe report informed that eWaste in 2019 was mainly comprised of small equipment (17.4 Mt), large equipment (13.1 Mt), and temperature exchange equipment (10.8 Mt). Screens and monitors, lamps, small IT, and telecommunication equipment represented 6.7 Mt, 4.7 Mt, and 0.9 Mt respectively.\\n\\nUN noted that since 2014, the eWaste categories increasing fastest in total weight terms are: temperature exchange equipment (+7 per cent), large equipment (+5 per cent), lamps and small equipment (+4 per cent).\\n\\nAccording to the report, this trend is driven by the growing consumption of those products in lower-income countries, where those products improve the living standards. Small IT and telecommunication equipment have been growing more slowly, and screens and monitors have shown a slight decrease (-1 per cent), explained largely by lighter flat panel displays replacing heavy cathode ray tube (CRT) monitors and screens.\\n\\nIt however, revealed that since 2014, the number of countries that have adopted a national e-waste policy, legislation or regulation has increased from 61 to 78. While a positive trend, this is far from the target set by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) which is to raise the percentage of countries with an eWaste legislation to 50 per cent.\\n\",\n  \"createdAt\": \"2020-07-01T12:35:12.509Z\",\n  \"creatorId\": \"UbDb4ITEdd-J\"\n}, {\n  \"_id\": \"3ALIAmoc9CSvdaowXxrAI\",\n  \"image_link\": \"https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Feature_Image_Tosin_Faniro_Dada.jpg\",\n  \"caption\": \"Lagos tasks youths on tech talent development, graduates 18\",\n  \"author\": \"\",\n  \"source\": \"Guardian\",\n  \"source_link\": \"https://guardian.ng/technology/lagos-tasks-youths-on-tech-talent-development-graduates-18/\",\n  \"category\": \"tech_inno\",\n  \"headings\": \"tech_inno\",\n  \"abstract_cat\": \"top_stories\",\n  \"content\": \"Lagos State Government through the State Employment Trust Fund (LSETF), has tasked youths on the need to become more creative, and develop competencies in information, and communication technology (ICT).\\n\\nSpeaking at the virtual graduation ceremony of the first cohort of 18 students that participated in the Lagos Innovates Talent Development Programme, an initiative by Honeywell Group and the LSETF, the Implementation Manager, LSETF, Tosin Faniro-Dada, said ICT is key to 21st Century development.\\n\\nShe said: “In a time of so much disruption and uncertainty, your graduation brings rays of excitement and some sense of normalcy.

Last week, someone sent me a message and said, Ife, you’re the ‘E’ in extra and I love it.. I’ve accepted the title.\\n\\nJune tested my existence. From the first day to the end! Everyday was a horror movie. On the first of June, I woke up in soooo much pain! It started with headaches first, then body pains. I went into the hospital and I was diagnosed of a bacterial infection.\\n\\nI wasn’t surprised with the result because someone who was also with me had also tested for bacterial infection in a totally different hospital, so I just took the meds they gave me and went home. Later that evening, my head was pounding like a machine. My body felt like someone was using a hammer to hit it all over. My temperature was extremely high, the pain all over was UNBEARABLE! I went back into the hospital at midnight, this time, I was admitted.\\n\\nThey gave me more pain meds through IV… NOTHING WORKED. I was restless, in pain, I begged for sleeping pills so I could forget the pain. Obviously, they didn’t give me. I was wide awake all night.\\n\\nThe next day… I was discharged with a new set of meds. All they gave me didn’t work. I decided to chest it. I went back on Friday and Saturday to complain that I wasn’t getting better… at this point, I couldn’t really talk again. It felt like I had 3 safety pins in my throat and the inner part of my neck was sewn together. I couldn’t talk..nothing.\\n\\nThen a doctor randomly said I should just try to get tested for COVID since nothing was working, she then gave me a number to one of the centers on the island. I called them, till date, they didn’t get back to me.\\n\\nI then decided to take matters into my own hands.. I had an AGS Tribe members husband who was a doctor, I called him immediately to tell him I wanted to get tested, unfortunately, he wasn’t on land, so he couldn’t test me… then one of my egbons sent a doctor to my house that night… I got tested with the Rapid Antigen test and I was POSITIVE! My life flashed before my eyes…\\n\\nOnce I found out. I called my hospital… the one that admitted me to let them know, so they could disinfect the place etc and also check if I could get any medical care from them. Alas, they told me there was a care package they sent to their patients etc and asked for my address, that they’d get it delivered… 30mins later, I got a call that they wouldn’t be delivering it again because my result wasn’t from NIMR or NCDC. I wept! They literarily abandoned me.\\n\\nMy self isolation started. The pain was continuous. I had to buy Zithromax 500mg (azithromycin), Zinc 10mg, Vit c 1000(effervescent) 1 daily\\nMethodex cough syrup\\nThen the chloroquine (pls don’t buy these drugs without proper medical diagnosis)\\n\\nAnytime I took the Methodex, it felt like I was drinking fire! I cried. Jumped everything each time I took it! I was porging uncontrollably. There was a time I felt like I wanted to poo, I got up and I saw the poo on the floor! I couldn’t even laugh, poo would come out. I couldn’t sit up or hold a conversation for 30mins, I’ll be dizzy and weak. It was a NIGHTMARE! Literarily one month of terror. The dizziness didn’t stop. I also had to do the hot water and aboliki steam inhalation, drink the lemon and ginger mix. Everything.\\n\\nOn the 15th, I went to NIMR to do another test, I was still positive. I couldn’t even stand straight. It was horrific. I sent a message to my doctor to let them know I now had the result from NIMR and it was still positive. The response I got was ‘OK’, no empathy, no nothing, no ‘hope you feel better’ nothing. I’m so thankful for the Doctor who got me tested and the AGS members husband, Dr. Kayode who literally took care of me like…. they picked up my calls at midnight, early morning. They never got tired. Always advising me and telling me what to use or buy! It was a horrific period. On top of everything, my sister passed on, on my late brothers birthday, Aunty Ibidun passed, Lamide was murdered, many died from COVID… June was a huge mess.\\n\\nBut I’m moving on. Finally, on the 27th, I was tested negative and I’m just here to thank God and you all know that COVID19 is BLOODY REAL! I did everything, washed my hands, sanitized, used masks and shields but I still got it AT HOME. I do not wish the pain I felt in the last month on my enemy! Please stay safe. You don’t know how your body will react to the virus. Mine was crazy but I’m thankful my breathing wasn’t affected.\\n\\nDuring this time, my support system was LIT! @ajilawson of @kstonecc kept on calling to pray with me, @funkebucknor @derojuoa, thank you so much for the communion. @tunde_ode , my friends, my family, Lord, I’m grateful. God bless you all. Even though I was in isolation, I never felt alone.

Some symptoms of the sickness were coughing, she was feeling weak, and also had pains….\\n\\nSo on the 25th of July 2020 we decided to move her to the New general hospital Asaba,, she walked down through our house stairs all by herself even though she was weak..\\n\\nMy Dad and my siblings got to the hospital with her and they refused to admitted treatment because the whole doctors were afraid that it was Covid19 as everyone will suspect… They abandoned her in pains for over an hour before they decided that they are not going to treat her except she Isolated in their Isolations center.. and also her oxygen leve became low in the hospital…\\n\\nI always said that they shouldn’t ahve moved her there cos my mum hadn’t gone anywhere to to have Covid even through out the time my sister who has health issues was taking care of her at home she didn’t posses any sign of transfer from my mom so I was fully sure within myself that it was not Covid..\\n\\nBut since the doctors and everyone refused to treat her we allowed her to in and she was put on oxygen…\\n\\nThey Isolated her in the Center and she was there without no good attention which I can swear to because we spoke to her regularly and she said no doctor or anymore had gone to see.. we took food to her regularly,,,\\n\\nThen Until the 26th of June 2020 being yesterday My Dad went with my brother to take things for her at the Isolation Center.. They agreed with my dad that since the case was not yet confirmed and the test result was yet to be out,, that he could stay and watch her and if anything goes wrong he could call them on phone from the room which he regularly did but they did not respond to him fast whenever her did…\\n\\nWe stayed awake at home through out the night praying for the life of my mum and talked to my brother who was there with her regularly and he always said that no one was coming to check on her upon they had a CCTV camera in their Isolation rooms…..\\n\\nWhenever we call the doctors from home they would say that they have gone to check her and she’s okay but my brother would still say no one has come and she is very weak and breathing slowly… This situation of calling and lying by the Covid 19 doctors happened for over 1hour…is that not wicked of them.\\n\\nThis morning at around 5 o’clock am when the calls and lies of the doctors that she was doing fine and attending to her.,, we decided to go to the hospital ourselves since my brother was crying bitterly that mom is laying dead….\\n\\nWhen we got there around After 5am we went forward to the Covid19 area with out car and kept on screaming that they should go and look at my mum but you know what we were there for over an hour no single Doctor came out to speak to us and these were the same doctors that were telling us that she’s fine and taken care of while we were at home…\\n\\nOut of bitterness I moved into the Covid19 session which they did not lock well and was screaming for help of the doctors and no one still Came out for over an hour… I went into her room that has A CCTV camera where they monitor everything from and started praying but to no avail and no one was still responding to us patients coming out of their wards in the room to complain why the doctors should be so wicked hearing my family’s voice screaming…..\\n\\nTo note: They did and X Ray which showed she had acute pneumonia which could av obviously been the cause of the Covid 19 symptoms she was experiencing but the doctors were not going to attend to her well until the result was going to be out and now my mum is dead….. They couldn’t even face the acute Pneumonia but concluded it’s a Covid 19 case without adequate test… What if the result is out now and it is negative please who killed my mother… Issit not the Doctors….\\n\\nPlease all I need is justice for my mum and support to my family.. She was a Bread winner for us and the one who took care of us always… I don’t know where to go or what to do from here… please I need everyone right now cos it’s like I am single in my world at the moment… Who would take of me ?

He expressed government’s commitment to ensure timely delivery of the landmark gas pipeline project within budgetary allocation and specifications. “We promised the nation that we will expand the critical gas infrastructure in the country to promote the use of gas in the domestic market. These include the Escravos to Lagos Pipeline System – 2 (ELPS-2), Obiafu to Obrikom (OB3) pipeline and AKK. “These projects are fundamental to our desire to industrialize and energize the entrepreneurial spirit that is ever present in our population,” the President added.

And that is why people’s expectation and judgment of the efficiency of parliament is falsely premised. The false premises may be because the parliament is the youngest among the three arms of government in Nigeria.”\\n\\nAccording to him, many people expect parliamentarians to construct roads, drainage and other infrastructures when they are clearly the job of the executive, and added that parliament existed to pass laws to guarantee the welfare of the people.

The former senate president giving an example, said the senate under him, through the Committee on Ethics, Privileges and Public Petitions treated 192 cases, noting that no senate handled up to 20 before him.\\n\",\n  \"createdAt\": \"2020-07-01T09:42:36.013Z\",\n  \"creatorId\": \"UbDb4ITEdd-J\"\n}, {\n  \"_id\": \"2H79_wtubhdWGXm6cuglB\",\n  \"image_link\": \"https://cdn.onlinenigeria.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/trumps-old-obama-insults-come-back-to-haunt-him-amid-new-russia-scandal.jpg?iv=153\",\n  \"caption\": \"Trump’s Old Obama Insults Come Back To Haunt Him Amid New Russia Scandal\",\n  \"author\": \"Webby\",\n  \"source\": \"OnlineNigeria\",\n  \"source_link\": \"https://onlinenigeria.com/stories/110005-trumps-old-obama-insults-come-back-to-haunt-him-amid-new-russia-scandal.html\",\n  \"category\": \"politics\",\n  \"headings\": \"not\",\n  \"abstract_cat\": \"none\",\n  \"content\": \"In yet another case of a “tweet for everything,” President Donald Trump’s old attacks on former President Barack Obama aren’t aging very well.\\n\\nThe New York Times reported that Trump received a written briefing in February about a Russian military unit that paid bounties to Afghan militants for killing American soldiers.

It furnishes national and regional COVID task forces with user-generated survey data, and actionable health and economic insights that will enable authorities to better analyse pandemic-related problems and implement appropriate responses.\\n\\nDirector of Africa, CDC, Dr. John Nkengasong, said the platform offers a “unique opportunity to change the way we conduct disease surveillance, enhance our ability to acquire good and timely data, and make all Africans count.”\\n\\nThe launch was presided over by the President Congo, Denis Sassou Nguesso, who lauded the initiative and noted that it “responds to member states’ requests for assistance in collecting and processing essential data to respond effectively to COVID-19.”\\n\\nPresident of Guinea, Alpha Condé, pledged to “make sure that all 55 AU member states are part of this initiative (ACIP).” He said the uncertainties around COVID-19 make a strong case for Africa to speedily embrace the fourth industrial revolution, ensuring better internet access and affordability.\\n\\nSongwe also deplored the state and high cost of Internet access in Africa, saying: “In an era of pandemic and economic crisis, it’s even more difficult for people to spend the little resources they have to pay for access.”\\n\\nThe good news, however, is that while ECA is working with key stakeholders to solve the problem of internet access, reliability, and cost, the ACIP can already reach over 80% of Africa’s mobile users without adding the burden of cost on them.\\n\\n“We, as operators, can waive the charges for USSD because chances are that many people battling the pandemic in some rural areas may not have airtime,” said CEO of MTN, Robert Shuter.\\n\\nHe said the uniqueness of the ACIP initiative got MTN and its “competitors to agree that this was an area for collaboration and cooperation.”Shuter said the technology can be used on any handset and on any device, and that the platform “presents a very simple menu to users and enables us to collect very important information that policymakers can use to identify where the issues and hotspots are.”\\n\\nThe launch was also attended by African ministers in charge of ICT, who urged stakeholders to ensure that there were synergies between the ACIP and efforts being made in the area of digital technology to combat COVID-19 at the national levels.\\n\\nITU’s Secretary-General, Houlin Zhao, called on African regulators and ICT ministers to “back this new platform.” He said artificial intelligence and big data are at the heart of the ACIP and that the support of telecommunication regulators from each country is “absolutely needed.”\\n\\nAbout 36 African member states are already part of the initiative.

Foreign exchange inflows in Nigeria have taken a hit from a plunge in crude oil prices, which account for 90% of such earnings.\\n\\nSpeaking at its virtual annual investor conference media roundtable, CEO of EFG Hermes Frontier, Ali Khalpey, noted that the progress made by Nigeria in the last 15 years needs to be sustained, and policies have to be accelerated to drive growth and investments.\\n\\n“Liberalisation policies need to be accelerated. You can’t trap people into markets, because once they are able to get out, they won’t get in again. Nigeria needs to be compelling to attract needed capital into the country,” he added.\\n\\nNigeria’s ability to attract sustainable foreign direct investments (FDIs) remained weak, as the bulk of imported capital continues to be dominated by portfolio investments, otherwise known as ‘hot money’.\\n\\nWith oil prices remaining unstable, there are concerns about the quality of investment attracted into the economy, especially when investors are becoming jittery about the stability of the Naira, and Nigeria’s capacity to service its debts.\\n\\nOf the $5.85billion received in the first quarter (Q1) of 2020, portfolio investment accounted for 73.61% ($4.31billion) of the total capital importation recorded by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).\\n\\nHead of Frontier Research, Kato Mukuru, reiterated the need to allow policies to drive investments, noting that investors will make in-roads to sectors that show clarity and growth potential.\\n\\nOn weakened consumption, he said: “There is a lot of uncertainty as regards consumption. There is a huge gap in the exchange rates. What we need to do is go back to the days where there is no gap in the exchange rates. People are not going to spend money when they are not sure about price stability. Foreign exchange is key to the whole thing. We are forecasting N420/$1 by the end of the year.\\n\\n“We also seek clarity on policies, taxation and intervention affecting consumer spending. Once the market gets clarity, things will change.”\\nChief Executive Office, EFG Hermes Holding, Karim Awad, said: “The conference is being held in the middle of significant global economic changes as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have effects, with special challenges facing Frontier Emerging Markets (FEMs). Lockdowns and the resultant decrease in global trade earnings, coupled with a contraction in portfolio inflows have strained several countries’ financial positions.\\n\\n“Meanwhile, the rapid fall in oil and commodity prices has put pressure on those countries, which are dependent on natural resource extraction. International credit rating agencies have downgraded significant stocks of FEM debt, while hundreds of countries have approached the IMF for emergency funding.”\\n\\nDespite current challenges facing FEMs, co-CEO of the Investment Bank at EFG Hermes, Mohamed Ebeid, believes changes in the macro picture might create new opportunities for countries, markets and companies.\\n\\nHe said: “We do see the prospect of some relief from immediate pressures, with an easing of FEM portfolio outflows expected as major central banks continuing to implement large expansionary programs. We could also see a floor put under commodity price drops as major oil producers solidify their commitment to large output cuts.”\\n\\n“Investors and executives will nevertheless have to navigate a changed landscape, where previously more-or-less hidden structural trends come to the fore and accelerate.

It said none of the senatorial zones can honestly say it has not taken a chance at governing Anambra state since 1999.\\n\\nThe group also said that Anambra South lacked the moral credibility to insist that it must produce Obiano’s successor since politicians from the zone have contested in every governorship election in the state since 1999.\\n\\n“We are disturbed by the outcome of a recent meeting of Anambra south political and traditional leaders where they insisted that the zone must produce the next governor in 2021. It seems to us that some politicians are beginning to use the traditional institution to drive a political agenda that could balkanize the state.\\n\\n“Our cause for worry is that the zone is beginning to act like it can intimidate other zones of Anambra state into submission and silence. That cannot happen. Anambra state belongs to all of us and the governorship of the state is open to every Anambra son and daughter who wants to contest.\\n\\n“We cannot surrender the state to the whims of Anambra south traditional rulers and politicians including the state chapter of Ohanaeze Ndigbo. That is not possible. Ohanaeze Ndigbo has no say on which zone produces the governor of any state in the southeast. It must not interfere in the internal political issues of any state.\\n\\n“For emphasis, Anambra South has had the most opportunities to govern the state since 1999. If they failed to make the best use of the opportunity, they cannot now say they were cheated. No one cheated them. If you failed to graduate from the university, it will be uncharitable for you to go telling people that your father did not send you to the university.\\n\\n“Also, we recall that Prince Nicholas Ukachukwu, Sen. Andy Uba, Sen. Ikechukwu Obiora, Hon. Chuma Nzeribe, Prof. Charles Soludo, Barr. KOP Odidika, Engr. Betram Dim, Dr. Amanchukwu Ezike, Dr. Harry Oranezi, Barr. Obinna Uzor, Barr. Damian Okolo, all from Anambra south, were cleared by the PDP to contest the 2010 governorship election against Obi. Ukachukwu and Uba however moved over to Hope Democratic Party and Labour Party to become their governorship candidates after Prof. Soludo picked the PDP ticket.\\n\\n“We are aware that politicians from Anambra South have consistently contested in every governorship election in Anambra state. There has never been a time when they pulled out on the grounds that it was the turn of another zone. They contested when Chris Ngige was imposed on us by one of them.\\n\\n“They contested when Peter Obi was elected for a second term. They contested when Obiano was elected for both his first and second terms. If per chance any of them had won then, would they come now to sing zoning?\\n\\n“There is no doubt that Anambra state rotates the governorship among the three senatorial zones. But as it is now, all the zones have taken their turns. So, the logical thing to do is to begin the rotation afresh from the zone that wins the 2021 governorship election, not to ask others to stay away and only you to present candidates. That has never been done in Anambra state and will not begin now. Anambra South has no right to disenfranchise any zone of the state. Every qualified Anambra person has the right to vote and also to be voted for.\\n\\n“In fact, Anambra Ekunie is insisting that it is now the turn of Anambra people to elect their governor. We are done with the imposition of a governor on us. Our people must now rise to demand that their votes count and it must count for the most credible and most competent.\\n\\nLet all who are interested, male and female, young and old, from all the zones, enter the ring and let the people make their choice. That is our stand”, the statement read.\\n\\nAnambra Ekunie had in March also warned the Elders’ Council in the state against allowing itself to be used by the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) to market an internal policy of the party as a statewide decision that is binding on all citizens.\\n\\nIt had told the Elders’ Council that APGA’s decision to zone its governorship ticket to Anambra South is strictly a decision of the party which can not be binding on other political parties in the state.\",\n  \"createdAt\": \"2020-07-01T01:26:00.345Z\",\n  \"creatorId\": \"UbDb4ITEdd-J\"\n}, {\n  \"_id\": \"pKkMGknoaUCbrigXHNHFG\",\n  \"image_link\": \"https://i1.wp.com/www.pmnewsnigeria.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Taraba-State-Governor-Darius-Isiaku.jpg?resize=750%2C622&ssl=1\",\n  \"caption\": \"Edo: COVID-19 response team protest over unpaid stipends\",\n  \"author\": \" Timothy Omobude\",\n  \"source\": \"DailyPost\",\n  \"source_link\": \"https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_20200630_124014_346-1024x461.jpg\",\n  \"category\": \"politics\",\n  \"headings\": \"not\",\n  \"abstract_cat\": \"none\",\n  \"content\": \"Workers in the Edo state COVID-19 response team on Tuesday protested none payment of their stipends.\\n\\nThe protesters blocked the entrance gate to the office of the Hospital Management Board, HMB, in Benin City, the state capital.\\n\\nOne of the leaders of the protesters, Ojeme Emmanuel said some of them have only collected staggered days stipends for the number of days worked for in the month of April.

There is no sector in the world where criminal acts affecting critical sectors are not given special treatment.\\n\\n“Until people know that there are penalties for the specific crime of energy theft, this is not going to stop,” he said.\\n\\nHe also said the companies were working hard to ensure the availability of meters so that there would be greater transparency which would build customers’ confidence.\\n\\n“However, this has to be complemented by specific legislation.\\n\\n“Everywhere you go today, the incidence of meter bypass is rife.\\n\\n“If people are metered and they still steal energy, it shows you that the problem is not entirely available of meters.\\n\\n“There is a mindset that stealing electricity is okay and that needs to be corrected through the enactment of appropriate legislation,” Oduntan said.\\n\\nHe noted that non-payment for electricity got worse after the COVID-19 lockdown which began from April 2020 with the DisCos losing an average of N500 million a month in revenue because customers were insisting on getting free electricity.\\n\\nHe, however, said the DisCos were collaborating with security agencies and the judiciary toward enforcing actions that could deter energy theft.\\n\\nOduntan urged Nigerians to be more patriotic by stopping all forms of energy theft and helping the security agencies to nab those who engage in such illicit

Federal Legislators Seek Suspension of 774,000 Jobs Project\",\"author\":\"\",\"source\":\"Channelstv\",\"source_link\":\"https://www.channelstv.com/2020/06/25/enugu-records-30-new-covid-19-cases/\",\"category\":\"politics\",\"headings\":\"not\",\"abstract_cat\":\"intro\",\"content\":\"Deji Elumoye and Udora Orizu in Abuja\\n\\nFollowing Tuesday’s face-off between a joint committee of the National Assembly and Minister of State for Labour and Employment, Mr. Festus Keyamo, angry federal legislators yesterday passed a resolution suspending the implementation of the recruitment of 774,000 public works personnel, being supervised by the minister.\\n\\nThe modalities for the recruitment of beneficiaries of the programme had caused a rift between the two parties at a public hearing in Abuja on Tuesday.\\n\\n\\n \\nAccording to the National Assembly, the executive arm of government does not have an exclusive right over the recruitment programme for which N52 billion had been voted in the 2020 revised budget.\\n\\nThe lawmakers challenged President Muhammadu Buhari to go to court if he feels that the National Assembly is encroaching on his powers.\\n\\nThis was coming as President Buhari has warned political appointees and other government officials against using their positions to bestow undue advantage on anyone seeking government jobs and other favours.\\n\\nChairman of the Senate Committee on Media and Public Affairs, Senator Ajibola Basiru, who spoke to journalists on behalf of the two chambers of the National Assembly after an executive session of the Senate, also advised the presidency to approach the court if it feels its powers are being encroached upon by the legislature.\\n\\n“If the president sees that his powers are being encroached upon, he can approach the court of law. What we are saying is this – this project the way you are looking at it, it is as if it is an exclusively presidential project,” he stated.\\n\\nThe senator, while responding to a question, said the conception of the programme was not exclusive to the presidency, explaining that its conception, approval and funding are with the considered input of the National Assembly because it believes it’s going to be beneficial for the purpose of addressing the challenges of COVID-19.\\nAccording to him, government revolves around the three arms – executive, legislative and judiciary.\\n\\nHe said: “On your perspective on encroaching on the powers of the president, there is no exclusivity in terms of any programme that is to be implemented, except the National Assembly is not part of government. Government, as defined by the 1999 Constitution, has three components: legislative powers as stipulated in Section 4; executive powers Section 5 and the judicial power in Section 6.\\n\\n“It is the totality of these that constitute government. So, when you are saying the government is doing a programme, it is not President Muhammadu Buhari that is doing the programme; it is the government of the people. Implementation, appropriation and execution all rolled into one. There is no dichotomy such as encroaching on the powers of the president.\\n\\n“Assuming the National Assembly is opposed to the programme, we could not have approved it. You cannot appropriate, but we want to be sure that names don’t just fly.\\n\\n“The two chambers of the National Assembly asked the federal government to halt the programme until the implementation modalities are explained to the legislative arm.”\\n\\nBasiru and his counterpart in the House of Representatives, Hon. Benjamin Kalu, in a joint statement, said the suspension of the scheme was necessitated because the lawmakers were concerned about the proper and effective implementation of the scheme.\\n\\nThey also mandated their Committees on Labour and Employment to immediately invite the Minister of Labour and Employment and any other officials of the ministry to appear before the joint committee to brief it on the modality for the implementation of the engagement of 774,000 persons for public works.\\n\\nThe lawmakers said they want to ensure transparency of the process just as it was done with the National Social Register by the Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development.\\n\\nThe two-page statement read in part: ”The National Assembly reminds members of the public that the legislature as part of the conception of the programme, approved it and appropriated funds for its implementation as part of the COVID-19 response strategy. In accordance with the constitutional imperative of oversight, the legislature being important stakeholders in the democratic process, and elected representatives of the people needed to be appraised of modalities for implementation for effective feedback to our constituents and in ensuring that our constituents optimally participate in and benefit from the process. In view of the foregoing, the implementation of the programme shall be on hold pending proper briefing of the National Assembly.”\\n\\nKeyamo had engaged the federal lawmakers in a shouting match on Tuesday over the modalities for the implementation of the 774,000 public works recruitment which resulted in the minister being walked out over his refusal to apologise to the legislators for his comments.\\n\\nHowever, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, yesterday said the leadership of the House had commenced moves to resolve the face-off between the National Assembly and Keyamo.\\n\\nGbajabiamila, when he appeared at the Public Accounts Committee’s public hearing in Abuja, said the seeming differences would be resolved amicably within the next 24 hours.\\n\",\"createdAt\":\"2020-07-02T09:30:32.716Z\",\"creatorId\":\"UbDb4ITEdd-J\"},{\"_id\":\"JjqbWOt3wSfMOWheRDicm\",\"image_link\":\"https://www.channelstv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/COVID-19-COVIDDDD8.jpg\",\"caption\":\"Enugu

drug problem.\\nAround 269 million people used drugs in 2018, up 30 per cent from 2009, according to the statement released by Sylvester Tunde Atere, Outreach and Communications, UNODC Nigeria Country Office, Abuja.\\n\\n\\n \\n“While the increase reflects population growth and other factors, illicit drugs – including opiates and pharmaceutical opioids, cocaine and methamphetamine – are still more available, more diverse and more potent than before, challenging law enforcement, posing greater health risks and complicating efforts to prevent and treat drug use disorders,” the executive director said.\\n\\nThe statement said adolescents and young adults account for the largest share of those using drugs. Of the 11 million people who inject drugs, half of them are living with hepatitis C, and 1.4 million with HIV.\\n\\n“Only one out of eight people who need drug-related treatment receive it. One out of three drug users is a woman but women represent only one out of five people in treatment. People in prison settings, minorities, immigrants and displaced people also face barriers to treatment due to discrimination and stigma.\\n\\n“585,000 died in 2017 in relation to drug use, up one-quarter from 2008. Over the past decade, the total number of deaths due to opioid use disorders went up 71 per cent, with a 92 per cent increase among women compared with 63 per cent among men.\\n\\n“All over the world, we see that risks and consequences of drug use are worsened by poverty, limited opportunities for education and jobs, stigma and social exclusion, which in turn helps to deepen inequalities, moving us further away from achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.”\\n\\nHe said the COVID-19 crisis has intensified these challenges further still, overwhelming health systems and exposing the fragility of institutions and social safety nets.\\n\\nHe said the theme of this year’s International Day against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking, “Better Knowledge for Better Care”, highlights the need to understand drug dynamics trapping so many millions of people in a downward spiral, to inform balanced solutions that are based on scientific evidence, to know better what the issues are and to provide better care for those who need it.\\n\\nHealth-centred, rights-based and gender-responsive approaches to drug use and related diseases deliver better public health, and we need to do more to share this learning and support implementation, most of all in developing countries.\\n\\n“Governments pledged to advance such balanced, comprehensive and evidence-based responses in the 2019 CND Ministerial Declaration. In the COVID-19 recovery, we need all countries to act on their commitments, and show shared responsibility to tackle illicit drug supply and reduce demand. We need civil society and youth organisations to continue their efforts to support the vulnerable in their communities.\\n\\n“Together, we can pursue more effective prevention and protection, to build resilience as we build back better, and leave no one behind.”\\n\",\"createdAt\":\"2020-07-02T08:29:55.769Z\",\"creatorId\":\"UbDb4ITEdd-J\"},{\"_id\":\"KRMRAR-4BrSzsKxlJxHDq\",\"image_link\":\"https://storage.googleapis.com/thisday-846548948316-wp-data/wp-media/2020/06/c0c03e5e-fr-arazu-696x522.jpg\",\"caption\":\"COVID-19: The Madagascar Challenge and Nigeria’s Traditional Medicine Practitioners\",\"author\":\"\",\"source\":\"ThisDay\",\"source_link\":\"https://www.thisdaylive.com/index.php/2020/06/25/covid-19-the-madagascar-challenge-and-nigerias-traditional-medicine-practitioners/\",\"category\":\"health\",\"headings\":\"not\",\"abstract_cat\":\"none\",\"content\":\"David-Chyddy Eleke writes on claims by Rev Fr Arazu of inventing a herbal drug for COVID-19 while juxtaposing the Madagascar herbal mixture and the possibility of traditional medicine practitioners in Nigeria utilising a rich blend of herbs and roots to combat the rampaging pandemic\\n\\nRecently, President Muhammadu Buhari took delivery of a large consignment of COVID-19 herbal remedy, a product that allegedly cures the virus, and produced in Madagascar. The drugs were delivered by the president of Guinea Bisau, President Umaro Embalo.\\n\\n\\n \\nBuhari, receiving the consignment said he would wait for science to authenticate it before it could be put to use.\\n\\nBut back in Madagascar, President of the country, Andry Rajoelini had claimed that the remedy was already working ‘wonders’ for its people against the disease. This may have also prompted the purchase of the drug by the Ghanaian government and even Guinea Bisau.\\n\\nNigeria parades a huge number of traditional medicine practitioners who have also laid claims to several inventions which cures other diseases, and most people believe that if given the opportunity, traditional medicine practitioners can doing a surprise with the invention of the drug for COVID-19.\\n\\nDr Timothy Nkem, though a medical doctor told THISDAY that he cannot expressly dismiss the place of herbal medicine in the society. “I have been a medical doctor for several years, but I can testify to miracles that herbal remedies have worked in the lives of some of my patients. It may not be the same for everybody, but truth is there are people whose systems are more at home with those local drugs,” he said.\\n\\nAlready, the Chairman of Anambra State Traditional Medicine Board, Rev Fr Raymond Arazu has laid claims to the invention of a drug against the virus. In a recent interview with THISDAY, Father Arazu, a Holy Ghost father of the Catholic Church and a renowned traditional medicine practitioner of over 50 years practice, who is in his 90s, and fondly referred to as the living ancestor described the the invention of a herbal drug for COVID-19 by Madagascar as a challenge to Nigeria.\\n\\nHe said, “I cannot imagine a small nation like Madagascar boasting of a remedy for the novel Coronavirus, while Nigerian government is yet to accept the fact that some traditional medicine practitioners in Nigeria including himself have already invented a cure for the ailment.”\\n\\nArazu said that immediately after the news of the outbreak of the disease in China filtered out in December last year, his team, led by himself and his nephew, Mr Reginald Arazu, graduate of Chemistry, a known scientist and a traditional medicine practitioner went to work.\\n\\n“We studied the symptoms of the disease and found out that it operates like every other viral disease, except a little difference, which is that it is airborne. We cure viral disease here, and all we needed to do was to look at its symptoms, and now ensure that we find drugs that can work more effectively in curing most of those symptoms exhibited by the patients of the virus.\\n\\n“We came up with this drug (beckoning on a sachet powder on his table). We named it Chioma. We have treated patients who are showing symptoms of COVID-19 here, but when people come to consult with us and they tell us the symptoms, for the ones we suspect COVID-19, we have treated them. But what we will not do is to treat anyone who comes to us knowing he has the COVID-19. We simply tell them to contact NCDC (National Centre for Disease Control), because we are not allowed to treat them. But if someone comes and tells us the symptoms of his sickness, sometimes we suspect COVID-19 and we treat them and they get well.”\\n\\nArazu said there are other members of the Anambra Traditional Medicine Board who have also invented supposed cure for the COVID-19, and that they have met with the representatives of the Anambra State governor, Chief Willie Obiano who has also promised to push forward the invention to the federal government for approval.\\n\\nSpeaking of the World Health Organisation (WHO), usual dismissal of herbal inventions, Arazu regretted that those who knows nothing about the efficacy of herbal medicine are condemning inventions from Africa for the novel virus, when it has not been able to come up with solution themselves.\\n\\n“They call us unorthordox medicine, but in the real sense, traditional drugs are the orthodox ones, while they are the unorthordox ones. Traditional Medicine has always been there from the begining of creation. I have been in this business for over 50 years. I am a priest, I am not doing this to make money but my own way of helping humanity.\\n\\n“This drug (Chioma) underwent very thorough research before we came up with it. Though we have been told that the state governor will help see to its approval, but we know that the virus we are up against cannot wait for all the beaurocratic bottlenecks of government, so time is of essence.”\\n\\nReginald Arazu who manages Arazu’s health facility in Awka speaking on his findings on the COVID-19 and the stages the new invention went through and it’s composition said, “Let me tell you, this COVID-19 is like every other viral disease, except with slight difference. Once a virus enters your body, all the soldiers of the body will rush to it to attack it, and while they are battling the virus, they leave other ailment in the body, giving those ones the opportunity to thrive. That is why it is more dangerous for people who have underlying ailment.\\n\\n“So, what we did in the invention of this drug is to ensure that we lace it with solution to other diseases that are common among aged persons. While we are treating for the virus, other health conditions would also be benefiting from the treatment, and in that case, both the virus and other ailment in the body are tackled simultaneously.”\\n\\nOn the cost of the drug, he said, “Our drugs are usually very cheap. That is why you see that we do not have sophisticated packaging, which is one of the things that make products expensive.”\\n\",\"createdAt\":\"2020-07-02T08:28:40.445Z\",\"creatorId\":\"UbDb4ITEdd-J\"},{\"_id\":\"xjl9L6_kY71ZJJsLPSpA-\",\"image_link\":\"https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftse2.mm.bing.net%2Fth%3Fid%3DOIP.1EFC7A_wwjjPwZcqVyieFwEsDh%26pid%3DApi&f=1\",\"caption\":\"Pharmacists Threaten Nationwide Strike over FG’s Unwillingness to Meet Demands\",\"author\":\"\",\"source\":\"ThisDay\",\"source_link\":\"https://www.thisdaylive.com/index.php/2020/06/18/investment-in-iycf-nigerias-untapped-smart-development-plan/\",\"category\":\"health\",\"headings\":\"not\",\"abstract_cat\":\"none\",\"content\":\"The Association of Hospital and Administrative Pharmacists of Nigeria (AHAPN) has threatened to embark on a nationwide strike action over what it termed federal government’s unwillingness to accede to its demands.\\n\\nAHAPN is the umbrella body of pharmacists practicing in hospitals, clinics, Federal Ministry of Health (FMOH), and health agencies, among others, with over 5,000 members in the country.\\n\\n\\n \\nIn a statement made available to THISDAY Thursday and signed by the National Chairman, AHAPN, Dr. Kingsley Chiedu Amibor, the body said some of its demands include restructuring of the health sector, adjustment of the Consolidated Health Salary Structure (CONHESS), pay COVID-19 hazard allowance, provide personal protective equipment (PPE) for pharmacists and other healthcare workers, as well as payment of April and May 2018 salary arrears for pharmacists and some category of healthcare workers.\\n\\nAmibor said: “The federal government in 2014 adjusted the Consolidated Medica Salary Scheme (CONMESS) table for medical doctors and has since adjusted it twice without a single adjustment to CONHESS table for pharmacists and other healthcare professionals.\\n\\n“It is worthy of note that in 2008, there was a job evaluation in the healthcare sector which gave rise to CONHESS and CONMESS, taking into cognizance, relativity in salary and allowances; a recommendation that was intended to reduce the level of acrimony in the healthcare sector. Sadly, this recommendation was partially adopted with the adjustments to CONMESS without relative adjustment of CONHESS.”\\n\\nHe said government should immediate adjust CONHESS as has been continuously canvassed by pharmacists and other healthcare workers, in order to avoid needless strike actions and disruptions in service delivery in the healthcare sector.\\n\\nAmibor said: “Virtually every other healthcare professional with the exception of very few and pharmacists who practice in about 20 federal health institutions have not been paid the arrears to date. We have written several letters to government on this issue without any positive response yet.\\n\\n“We call upon government to release these arrears since it was captured in the 2020 Budget and provisions have been made for it. We call on government to provide adequate PPEs for pharmacists and other healthcare workers who are at the front line of the COVID-19 pandemic control efforts.\\n\\n“Additionally, we wish to remind government to honour her decision to pay enhanced hazard allowance to healthcare workers since March, 2020. This pronouncement has not translated into tangible result yet.”\\n\\nHe also said government’s refusal to register AHANP as a trade union was unfortunate, adding that it has applied severally to no avail.\\n\\n“About 2001, we were granted provisional registration as a trade union by the Federal Ministry of Labour and Productivity, but for some inexplicable reasons, our registration was withdrawn. All efforts by AHANP to get full registration since then proved abortive.”\\n\\nHe said the association was also using the opportunity to register it’s displeasure over non-inclusion of pharmacists at the recent meeting between the government and representatives of the different unions in the healthcare sector.\\n\\nDescibing the action as distasteful, he called on the federal government to urgently address the issues raised, as its unwillingness would mean the association would have no choice than to press home their demands through industrial action.\\n\",\"createdAt\":\"2020-07-02T08:26:52.722Z\",\"creatorId\":\"UbDb4ITEdd-J\"},{\"_id\":\"dJ0H9Hg5QYf0zOeDN2y5M\",\"image_link\":\"https://storage.googleapis.com/thisday-846548948316-wp-data/wp-media/2020/07/e1119786-alash-le-abimiku-696x522.jpg\",\"caption\":\"https://storage.googleapis.com/thisday-846548948316-wp-data/wp-media/2018/09/97bf2d41-mother-and-child-696x522.jpg\",\"author\":\"\",\"source\":\"ThisDay\",\"source_link\":\"https://www.thisdaylive.com/index.php/2020/06/18/investment-in-iycf-nigerias-untapped-smart-development-plan/\",\"category\":\"health\",\"headings\":\"not\",\"abstract_cat\":\"none\",\"content\":\"Global experts have stressed that investment in infant and young child feeding does not only improve the health and nutrition of children, but aids human capital development. Martins Ifijeh writes on the need for Nigeria to take advantage of this to address gaps in human and economic development in the country\\n\\nDuring the 2019 International Monetary Fund (IMF) Spring Meeting held in Washington DC, United States in April, world leaders raised alarm over growth challenge by the global economy, stressing that Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was in fast decline in many countries of the world, including Nigeria where the 2.10 per cent reported for Q1 2019 declined to 1.94 per cent in Q2 2019; amounting to -0.16 per cent drop.\\n\\nBut to address this, the Managing Director of IMF, Christine Lagarde was quick to call on countries to make smart investment plans. She believed investments in the ‘small boats’ were some of the smartest ways to economic prosperity with high return on investment assured. To her, investment in ‘small boats’ means investment in the poor and middle class.\\n\\n\\n \\nInvestment in Human Capital Development Low in Nigeria\\nAmong countries most affected by the lack of investment in ‘small boats’ is Nigeria. Its human capital development index is still at the lowest ebb when priority areas of the government are examined. The country channels high budgetary allocations to infrastructural development far more than human capital. In the 2020 National Budget, Power and Transportation take lion share of the allocations.\\n\\nOn specifics, the indices from the two areas used in accessing human capital development; health and education, showed that the country is still worse off. For instance, Nigeria has the second highest under-five death indices globally, and currently has the highest number of out of school children in the world; a figure, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) has put at 10.5 million children.\\n\\nInvest in Nutrition to Grow Economy\\nThe immediate past Chairman, Nigeria’s Senate Committee on Health, Senator Lanre Tejuoso, also at the Spring Meeting in Washington DC, mentioned that one of the smartest moves by Nigeria will be to invest in the nutrition of children, adding that its return on investment of one dollar equals 16 dollars and would in no small measure take the country out of poverty on the long run.\\n\\nAccording to him, investment in nutrition will not only improve the health of infants and young children, but will play a major role in how much these children will do well in school, in career as adults, generally on human development, as well as change the country’s economic index positively, overtime.\\nHe said: “The impact that will come from investing in the nutrition of children of under five in Nigeria cannot be ignored, especially since these children will later in life run the economy, as this investment now will determine if they ca successfully run the economy or bring it aground.”\\n\\nOn the reverse, poor nutrition has been shown to impede cognitive and physical development, which translates to decreased learning ability, reduced productivity in adult years, increased healthcare costs, and generally leads to poverty.\\n\\nAfrican countries lose an average of eight per cent of their annual GDP due to malnutrition. Micronutrient deficiencies alone result in a 1.5 billion dollars loss in Nigeria each year, according to the Nutrition Society of Nigeria.\\n\\nOn the flipside, every dollar invested in nutrition in Nigeria has an average return of nearly 16 dollars. These figures leave little doubt of the economic potential of nutrition. If the country is to compete in the global economy and supercharge the potential demographic dividend, it will need to ensure its children are well nourished.\\n\\nScaling up such proven interventions could help Nigeria reach the World Health Assembly (WHA) target of reducing stunting by 40 per cent by 2025 and adding 29 billion dollars to the Nigerian economy.\\n\\nThe Sorry State of Nigeria’s Malnutrition\\nAccording to the Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey, Nigeria has the second highest number of malnourished children in the world, just second to India, and way ahead of Somalia, Syria and other war-torn countries, as well as those with weaker economic strength.\\nThe survey also showed that Nigeria has the highest number of stunted children under age five in sub-Sahara Africa with 37 per cent of all children stunted, 18 per cent wasted, while 29 per cent are underweight, thereby making malnutrition the factor responsible for more than 50 per cent of under-five mortality in Nigeria.\\nIt is this sorry state that Senator Tejuoso described as a timebomb waiting to happen if the country’s levels of government refuse to scale up nutrition intervention across board.\\n\\nImproving Nutrition through IYCF Programme\\n\\nThe United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) said one of the effective programmes in addressing nutrition issues in the country is through the Infant and Young Child Feeding and programmes associated with it, which the Nigerian government and all state governments of the federation have signed on to.\\n\\nIt says promoting evidence-based IYCF, including exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life, feeding a diverse diet of nutritious foods and breastmilk from six to 23 months of life, feeding malnourished children with specialised food regime, were some of the interventions needed in addressing malnutrition in the country.\\n\\nCarrying out IYCF programme involves facility-based IYCF counselling for pregnant women and mothers with infants less than two years of age, facilitated by health workers; community-based IYCF counselling for pregnant women and mothers with infant less than two years of age, facilitated by community volunteers; and community-based meetings with fathers of infants less than two years of age and grandmothers, facilitated by community volunteers. If this is adequately funded and implemented to the letter, it is believed it will help in reducing the malnutrition burden in the country.\\n\\nEffect of Nutrition Investment to Infants and Young Children\\n\\nResearch has shown that women who get adequate nutrition during pregnancy, give exclusive breastfeeding to their new born for six months, as well as ensure adequate feeding until their baby clocks 1000 days of life, are more likely to have children who will do well in school, have healthier living, and are able to face the rigours of adulthood, while becoming assets to their immediate society and the nation at large.\\n\\nA study by the American Society of Nutrition has established a link between adequate nutrition before a child’s fifth birthday and the child’s high intelligent quotient.\\nThe study also says a well-nourished under-five year old child would develop a high cognitive prowess and physical capacity to add to a country’s GDP through proper learning and decision-making abilities, while a malnourished child may grow up to become suboptimal adult with under-performing economic abilities later in life.\\nA report by Orphan Nutrition, a humanitarian organisation showed that a deficiency in one nutrient may lead to a deficiency in another nutrient.\\n\\nFor example, deficiency in iron, magnesium and zinc can cause anorexia and thereby result in reduced intake of other important nutrients such as protein. Low lipid intake can also affect the absorption of important fat-soluble vitamins such as vitamins A and D. It also showed that zinc and protein deficiencies can retard bone growth and development, putting a child at risk for long-term complications.\\n\\nLack of Political Will, Major Hurdles to Investment\\n\\nWhile most political leaders, no doubt, believe in providing democratic dividends to their societies, they often prefer to invest in areas with tangible (physical) concerns, like building roads, schools and bridging, and donating sewing machines, among others, whereas investment in nutrition suffers because the immediate impact may not be visible to their electorates whom they plan to meet for validation of their re-election bid or general acceptance in the society.\\n\\nPush for Government Intervention\\n\\nWith various researches showing that investments in infant and young child feeding can turn around the economic fortune of any society, it is a no brainer for any government, whether, federal, state or local, which truly hopes to improve the quality of life of its people, not to give priority budget allocation to nutrition of its young ones.\\n\\nThe Convention on the Rights of the Child which Nigeria signed into, recognizes the right of the child to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health. The right also ensures government takes appropriate measures to, among other things: reduce infant and child mortality, combat disease and malnutrition, among others.\\n\\nWhile the federal government in 2016 budgeted a surprising, yet embarrassing N2 million for nutrition in the entire country, it however improved in 2017 to N1.2 billion, even though only about half of the figure was actually released. Almost same figures have been released since the last two years without significant increase, even though it says it hopes to become one of the strongest economies by 2030, if the Economic and Growth Recovery Plan (EGRP) of the federal government is to go by.\\n\\nSame lack of will has been seen among states who pay little attention to the nutrition of its under-five, while other sectors, with less bearing on the human capital development gets centre stage.\\n\\nIs the country ready to make smart investments to improve its economy? Time will tell.\",\"createdAt\":\"2020-07-02T08:23:55.465Z\",\"creatorId\":\"UbDb4ITEdd-J\"},{\"_id\":\"jaxJ3SJ26l2cVuNVlQDJe\",\"image_link\":\"https://storage.googleapis.com/thisday-846548948316-wp-data/wp-media/2020/07/e1119786-alash-le-abimiku-696x522.jpg\",\"caption\":\"Abimiku: With Investment in Research, Health Infrastructure, Citizen-support, Nigeria Will Defeat COVID-19\",\"author\":\"\",\"source\":\"ThisDay\",\"source_link\":\"https://www.thisdaylive.com/index.php/2020/07/02/abimiku-with-investment-in-research-health-infrastructure-citizen-support-nigeria-will-defeat-covid-19/\",\"category\":\"health\",\"headings\":\"not\",\"abstract_cat\":\"latest_news\",\"content\":\"Alash’le Abimiku is a Professor of Medicine at the University of Maryland, United States, and the Executive Director, International Research for Human Virology Nigeria. In this interview with Martins Ifijeh, she said fundamental investment in research, support from citizens, and establishment of health infrastructure can help Nigeria tackle the COVID-19 pandemic. She spoke on how the body has initiated ideas to support government’s efforts against the outbreak, and how long term approach will ensure the country is better equipped for future outbreaks\\n\\nWhat factors lead to drug resistant TB and why are cases rising during the COVID-19 pandemic?\\nWe know from long ago; tuberculosis is a bacterium. We know that when you expose bacterium to a drug for a limited period of time it also tries to survive by also building resistance. With resistance, there is a mutation within the bacteria’s gene that makes it now possible for it not to be susceptible to a particular drug. Historically, when a bacterium, in this case, mycobacterium tuberculosis is exposed for a period of time to drugs, it will develop a mechanism to continue to exist despite the drugs, hence, you see the resistance. You start with mono- resistance, resistance to one drug and then you see that as we move through treatment, people are treated with multiple drugs so that if the microorganism is resistant to one, the second would work. It takes some time for those microorganisms to develop resistance to those additional drugs, then you continue to add.\\n\\nYour second question is about COVID-19 and the fact that the numbers are increasing. Remember that we learn a lot from countries that are experiencing this pandemic. When you have your index case, you identify all those people that have come in contact with the index case to make sure that you limit the spread of the virus.\\n\\n\\n \\nUnfortunately, unless your prevention method is airtight and every citizen does what they are supposed to do, the virus will escape into the community. The moment it escapes into the community, each person interacts with additional individuals, and then it is expected that the cases will rise. It is not unusual, it happened in China, it happened in Spain, it is still happening in the US and in Italy. So we expect it to rise the moment it gets into the community, and that is why every single prevention method in terms of distancing, using soap and water, using sanitizer and using the face mask is absolutely critical for each and every person to do because our strength really depends on our weakest link. So, if we all, 90 percent of us are doing the right thing and 10 per cent are not doing it, we won’t get rid of COVID-19.\\n\\nA month ago, you told THISDAY IHVN reached out to the federal government concerning your efforts at COVID-19 researches and other supports. Have you gotten feedback from the government?\\nNo, not really, what we have done is we have submitted about five different proposals addressing different aspects of COVID-19 and one has to do with evaluation of the different devices within our population to see how well it works, how we can identify those who are infected, maybe also be able to identify, those that have built up immune responses and also be able to define the clinical symptoms within our population. We have submitted that. We had that the task force on research is considering one of the proposals that we put in to evaluate the different devices for testing COVID-19, one that you can use within very well established infrastructure and facility like IHVN or tertiary hospitals and those that you can use in rural areas where you don’t have dependable electricity. So, we heard that that is being reviewed, although no word yet whether it has been chosen. We have not also gotten any funding to continue that line of research\\n\\nAre you of the opinion many Nigerians do not believe there is COVID-19?\\nI guess it is expected. Actually, people do know a bit about coronavirus in the sense that we have had some other outbreaks before epidemics like this. The SARS and the MERS happened in the Middle East and some in China.\\nEpidemics mean that it is limited to certain parts of the geographical region. This is the first time we have had a coronavirus that has hit everywhere in the world and that is why it is called a pandemic. So I think the reason why everybody knows about coronavirus now is because it has really hit home and it has hit every single country and there is no day you put on the TV or the papers that you don’t read about it. I mean media outlets like yours have also educated the people.\\n\\nIf you remember HIV, we never knew about it until it hit and started killing people. In a similar vein, that is what has happened with the coronavirus. It belongs to the same corona virus family, this COVID-19 and the only difference is that this one is quite novel so all populations over the world have not seen it so everybody is susceptible, we don’t have any prior immunity to it. That is why all of the populations all over the world were very susceptible to it and you heard about the different routes of transmission that makes all our interactions as human beings a potential for transmitting the virus. So I believe that because of the overwhelming spread of the virus all over the world, because of the way that it has affected our interactions with each other, the way that it has affected our ability to move within homes, to the office, to travel out, it is really a significant media topic.\\nIs it possible to teach coronavirus and the pandemic in schools, putting into consideration the philosophy of our educational system.\\n\\nThat may be a very good idea. One of the things that we have done as a nation or as a population and we haven’t done a good job with is that we do not anticipate. When we had the pandemic flu, H1M, SARS, and when we had all of those things, it was very clear for the public health individual that this will continue to be a public health challenge, because it wasn’t a matter of if, but when it is going to happen again. So, I think they should be taught in schools. We haven’t done a good job in teaching public health.\\n\\nPreparedness is the one thing you can do to prevent any virus spread because viruses by nature are not that sensitive to drugs. We have a lot of antibiotics and drugs that you can take but it is mostly against parasites and bacteria. Viruses are really based on our human nature so sometimes when you have a pandemic, it is because it has jumped across species to a new one.\\n\\nIn school, we should focus on public health threats and preparedness. When Ebola came, we were having temporary fix; forgetting that isolation units, protective gear, having the laboratories that can do the tests would also work perfectly for corona but you see, when we do things as if they are temporary fix. If we don’t establish it in school, in our government, in our facilities, then we are never prepared. This is here and would stay with us as long as man lives and continues to interact. We would always have those kinds of outbreaks. It’s not rocket science; it just needs commitment in terms of our policy makers and our educational system to really keep that in the forefront of our response.\\n\\nAppears the federal government is silent on vaccines and treatment drugs for COVID-19, as it is believed no fund has been released yet for this. Are there other ways we can come up with vaccines and drugs outside getting funding from government?\\nThe point you brought up is a good one. That is why IHVN existence is based on obtaining funds and getting grants to do the work, but that does not exonerate the government from investing in research. If you look at other countries, they prepare for epidemics. These countries work for years in building infrastructures and capacity in this area.\\nThe National Institute for Pharmaceutical Research and Development (NIPRD) was successful some time ago in getting drugs, so the bottom line is there are some fundamental infrastructure and investment that government must make first and foremost whether through the International Monetary Fund (IMF) or through the World Bank, the Dangotes or through Gates. There are fundamental investments they need to do that no one grant can do.\\n\\nOnce they do that fundamental investment in research, build the infrastructure and the machinery and everything that will allow your scientist to do the work; then your scientist can now apply for grants that allows them get the reagents and to follow their ideas. There has to be that prior investment and it has to be long-term.\\n\\nThe second thing I will say quickly is that also, each nation must know its capacity. Don’t go and start competing with the western world on putting together a vaccine. The western world has a lot more infrastructure and has a lot more funding. They’ve been doing it for years. Then, you suddenly wake up one night and think that you are going to compete with vaccines, you will not. Find the areas that you are strong in.\\n\\nOne of the things that we know we have, for sure, are local herbs and different activities that we do, that we know that there may be something that we can contribute to the rest of the world, like Madagascar did. Let’s put our money in there, like NIPRD and other organisations, it’s all collaboration. There is no one institution that can do it. Government has to be very clever in how it uses its limited resources and its limited infrastructure in what is it that is unique that we can go in and compete intelligently with the rest of the world and contribute to the answers.\\n\\nCan’t Nigeria look towards using local herbs to address this COVID-19, rather than looking out for herbs from Madagascar and other places?\\nJust quickly to tell you that I know for a fact this is one of the areas being considered. I am member of a scientific advisory committee for NIPRD and in fact, in addition to looking at claims internationally and locally, this is being looked at. Again, my concern is the fact that what are we doing until these things happen? We got institutions that their main goal is really to look at things like that.

The scale and demand for tele-medicine services is overwhelming today.\\n\\n“Hence, we decided to tie up with HelloDoc.

As businesses continue to grapple in these unprecedented times, if there is one thing needed more than anything else to keep going, its innovation. And MeCure Smart seems to be innovating in the right direction.\\n\\n“The COVID-19 pandemic would long be remembered in our lifetimes as probably the single major worldwide event that changed consumer behaviour almost overnight. Even mundane tasks such as grocery shopping or a simple walk in the park now come with social distancing guidelines and protocols.\\n\\n“However, the pandemic has also forced businesses to rethink their strategy and make favourable and long-term changes.\\n\\n“Consumers have also shown an overwhelming interest in placing the health and safety of their families first and are adopting innovative ways to interact in these unprecedented times,” he said.\\n\\nAccording to him, access to quality and safe healthcare is quite simply the most important need not just for Nigerians but citizens of every country in the world.\\n\\nDisinfection Solution against Viruses, Bacteria, Fungi Debuts in Nigeria*\\n\\nAs the country and the world in general slumps into the doldrums of the deadly coronavirus (COVID-19), a new solution that eliminates the external impact of viruses, bacteria, and fungi, awakens hope and assurances of safety for people as the Nigerian Economy gradually re-opens.\\n\\nThis disinfection solution, manufactured by Diversay Solutions Limited, is a combined supply of Diversay Disinfection Tunnel (DDT) and the Diversay Disinfectant.

The populace will have to weigh their options, whether their lives have improved in the last three and half years, whether the economy has improved, whether the security has improved, whether the education system has improved. If there is no improvement, the obvious thing is to have another government in place. This election will give a verdict about Akeredolu’s performance. And I believe that the PDP is standing a good chance to take over”.\\n\\nJegede, who was the governorship candidate of the PDP in the 2016 election hinged his optimism on the alleged dismal performance and dwindling popularity of the APC in the state.\\n\\nJegede described the defection of the Deputy Governor of the state, Hon Agboola Ajayi as a welcome development that would further weakened the chances of the APC in the election.\\n\\n“There is no cause for alarm. If APC is a good party, the gentleman would not leave the party and if he has good chances in APC, he would not have left the party. I am not afraid of competition”.\\n\\nHe noted that since 2016 the PDP in Ondo State has grown to become a formidable party and united to defeat the APC and provide better governance for the people of the state.\\n\\nHe noted that in 2019 general election, the PDP got more votes in the presidential election than the APC and got two senates.\\n\\nHe said, “Before 2019, APC had all the three Senators, but in 2019, they lost two to the PDP. Secondly, in 2015, APC had highest votes in the presidential election but in 2019 PDP scored majority of votes despite the fact that APC was in government both at the federal and state level.

But reaching this goal will depends on our community of passionate people on the ground, policymakers, regulators and businesses embracing IXPs and working in collaboration to create these essential local traffic anchors,”\\n\\nThe report commended Nigerian government for not only making it easier for different service providers to develop sub-marine cables, but also adopted data protection regulations that spurred confidence and attracted international service providers.\\n\\nAnalysing the report with The Guardian, the Chief Executive Officer, IXPN, Muhammed Rudman, said the report is a testament to the good happenings in Africa, especially in Nigeria, as it captured the country’s growth and the impact made in the last eight years.\\n\\n“The over 400 fold in growth of local traffic is significant, which translates to about 70 per cent traffic for most of the service providers connected to IXPN. We hope to sustain this trajectory and to provide similar services to other regions within the country,” he stated.\\n\\nRudman further said the feat was achieved because the IXP was able to attract content providers, especially the big players such as Google, and Facebook. He said the establishment of more data centres in Nigeria also aided the growth.\\n\\nAccording to him, the realization that Nigerian companies needed to host their data locally, which hitherto they routed abroad also contributed significantly. He added that the fibre link interconnection, which ensured the connection of all the exchanges in the country also made things easier.\\n\\n“A lot of Nigerians are now hosting their servers locally, and we have attracted some of the big players in Internet content into the country, such as Google, Facebook and Alkamire, and presently we are trying to bring other bigger ones to the country,” he stated.\\n\\nHe urged smaller Internet service providers (ISPs) to connect to the IXPN in order to widely peer with other members and increase the efficiency of their interconnections, disclosing that IXPN covers eight Point of Presence (POP) across Nigeria.\\n\\nTo improve on the growth, the IXPN CEO, appealed to the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) to ensure the compliance with the Local Content Guidelines; ensure that all government’s websites, and emails are hosted in Nigeria.\\n\\nRudman said educational institutions should also be encouraged to host in some of the data centres in the country.\\n\\nIXPN Point of Presence (POP) in Nigeria includes four in Lagos and one each in Abuja, Port Harcourt, Enugu and Kano. The Lagos POP connects both to each other and to the POP in the other four cities in an effort to extend connectivity to the unserved and underserved,” he said.\\n\\nIXPN in 2015 emerged as a regional exchange for West Africa with the support of the African Union Commission; which is aimed at reducing the latency and save costs by eliminating international transit through overseas carriers.\\n\",\"createdAt\":\"2020-07-01T13:01:23.249Z\",\"creatorId\":\"UbDb4ITEdd-J\"},{\"_id\":\"7-Ueq1K-K_50afcMvF5VT\",\"image_link\":\"https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Ferdie-Moolman.jpg\",\"caption\":\"Operators donate kits, offer free SMS in COVID-19 fight\",\"author\":\"\",\"source\":\"Guardian\",\"source_link\":\"https://guardian.ng/technology/operators-donate-kits-offer-free-sms-in-covid-19-fight/\",\"category\":\"tech_inno\",\"headings\":\"not\",\"abstract_cat\":\"top_stories\",\"content\":\"Two players in Nigeria’s information and communications technology (ICT) sector have further donated equipment kits and services to the government in the fight against COVID-19.

This aptly fits the present circumstances surrounding the Executive Vice Chairman, Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), Prof. Umar Danbatta, who has successfully earned a second term of five years in office.\\n\\nDanbatta, who was appointed into office on August 4, 2015, for his first term, has had it good, bad and ugly. But, analysts believe that his positive contributions to the industry outweigh the downside of his first five years as the chief executive officer of NCC.\\n\\nIt is on this premise that the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Pantami, who recommended Danbatta to President Muhammadu Buhari for a second term, called on the EVC and his team to redouble their efforts towards actualising the digital economy agenda of the Federal Government.\\n\\nThe Minister spoke when the Executive Management of the Commission led by Danbatta paid him a courtesy visit on Monday.\\n\\nAccording to the Minister, the proactive decision to recommend Danbatta’s reappointment to the President for approval was “to ensure stability in the telecommunications industry and consolidate on the gains and successes already recorded in the industry in the last five years of Danbatta’s leadership as the EVC of NCC.”\\n\\nPantami, however, emphasised the need for the Danbatta-led NCC Management to work more harmoniously with the Ministry and agencies, towards ensuring effective implementation of the National Digital Economy Policy and Strategy (NDEPS) as well as thorough implementation of the new National Broadband Plan (NBP), 2020-2025.\\n\\n“The success of the Commission is our collective responsibility. While we, as a Ministry, do our best to formulate general industry policy and supervise the activities of the Commission, I will urge the NCC family to be united, remove all lines of demarcation, ensure justice, fairness in all decisions and above all, ensure harmonious relationships. This task lies on the table of the EVC,” he pointed out.\\n\\nSpeaking further, Pantami reminded the EVC that the focus of President Buhari is currently to boost the digital economy, which, he said, has become even more important following the experience of COVID-19 pandemic that has left many individuals and organisations relying more on digital platforms for work and collaboration.\\n\\n“So, we expect the NCC, as the telecoms regulator, to take the issue of the digital economy very seriously and give it all the attention it deserves within the Commission,” he said.\\n\\nProtecting small telcos\\nWhile congratulating the EVC for earning a second term in office, the Chairman of the Association of Licensed Telecoms Operators of Nigeria (ALTON), Gbenga Adebayo, said his reappointment is a testimony of his good leadership under, which the industry has made significant progress.\\n\\nGoing forward, Adebayo, an engineer, tasked the EVC on the need for the regulator to protect the smaller players and ensure they survive in the interest of competition and the consumers.\\n\\nThe ALTON chairman posited that Danbatta’s second term will bring about consistency for the progress of the industry.\\n\\nOn his part, the President of the Association of Telecommunications Companies of Nigeria (ATCON), Olusola Teniola, said the EVC needs to ensure that the Nigerian Broadband Plan 2020-25 is implemented in a timely manner, and that lessons learnt from the 2013-18 plan should be adhered to, to avoid the painful mistakes identified in the current plan.\\n\\nTeniola said the focus should be on affordability of Internet access and the digital transformation the industry needs to undertake for continued relevancy in the digital realm.\\n\\n“We are behind in fibre rollout and behind in 4G coverage, so NCC under his leadership needs to fully collaborate with ATCON members and the wider industry stakeholders to build a robust digital infrastructure that is fit for purpose\\n\\n“Finally, it is well recognised that as an industry and during COVID-19 lockdown directives that our networks are heavily relied on to act as an enabling platform for the Nigerian Digital Economy. For that to be the case the industry needs to fund the building of such platform as envisioned in the Nigerian Broadband Plan in a spirit of collaboration. This means that the industry will be undergoing tremendous change to adapt to the new norm. Digital skills are paramount and these skills are required for the continued growth of our industry,” he stressed.\\n\\nStakeholders call for collaborations\\nFor the sector to thrive better, especially in the next five years, stakeholders have called for collaboration among operators and the regulator.\\n\\nManaging Director of Rack Centre, Tunde Coker, the sector is capable of increasing its contributions from the current 14 per cent to 20 per cent in another two years, if government can pivot away from oil and give ICT a diversification priority.\\n\\nCoker said collaboration between the regulator and players in the sector will play an important role\\nin positioning the sector positively.\\n\\nChief Executive Officer (CEO) VDT Communication, Biodun Omoniyi, COVID-19 brought huge responsibility on the sector, “and we didn’t fail. However, lots still need to be done post-pandemic. Collaborations among players and governments at all levels will be key.”\\n\\nThe Country Manager, Avanti, Jane Egerton-Idehen, made case for faster implementation of the New National Broadband Plan 2020 to 2025, where she stressed the need for collaboration, especially between the sector and states governments that will further see to reduction of Right of Ways,” as COVID-19 has further stretched the timing for some aspect of the plan to be realised.”\\n\\nThe last five years\\nMeanwhile, part of the developments that came to the industry was an increase in the sector’s investment.\\n\\nFor instance, four years ago, the investment profile of the sector was around $38 billion. But today, it has grown to over $70 billion. Despite this, the telecom regulator has admitted the present investment in the sector is inadequate and will continue to pursue policies that would encourage more investment, stressing that Nigeria is one of the fastest growing telecommunications markets in the world.\\n\\nSpeaking at the maiden Nigerian Telecom Leadership Summit (NTLS) held in Lagos last year (2019), Danbatta, admitted: “The volume of telecom investment in Nigeria is very impressive and indicative of a very fast-growing and resilient sector of the economy. But, we will continue to advocate for more investment, giving that the industry was very capital intensive, with the competition for Foreign Direct Investments becoming fiercer among different nations.”\\n\\nIt is estimated that about 40 million Nigerians, especially those in the rural and semi-urban areas are yet to be reached with basic infrastructure and services, making the over $68 billion investment in the telecom industry inadequate and therefore committed to attracting more investment in the industry.\\n\\nStressing this during the NTLS, Danbatta stated: “The argument for more investments becomes more compelling, given that this industry is very capital intensive, with the competition for Foreign Direct Investments, FDls, becoming fiercer among different nations. In our consultative regulatory process, we consider shared experiences, and shared vision as the best approach to equip us with the tools to continuously reposition towards the course of effective regulation.”\\n\\nCurbing Menace of Call Masking, Call Refilling\\nIn the wake of 2017, the menace of call masking/call refilling and SIM boxing reared their ugly heads with a charge on NCC to find a lasting solution to the menace.\\n\\nBasically, call masking is when inbound international calls terminate in Nigeria as local number.\\n\\nThis raises security concerns, competition issue and portends negative economic implications. In fact, it is estimated that globally, call masking is causing economy $60 billion yearly.\\n\\nNCC, under Danbatta, tackled the menace by ensuring strict compliance monitoring and enforcement by the Commission; imposition of appropriate sanctions by NCC on licensees involved in call refiling and masking activities; and suspension of numbering plans of some perpetrators and withdrawal of all their inactive numbering plans.\\n\\nThese interventions generated results for the industry. First, call masking (otherwise called call line identity (CLI) spoofing) has since dropped to more than 40 per cent compared to how prevalent it as in January 2018. Also, SIM boxing traffic has been down by about\\n25 per cent as at September 11, 2018.\\n\\nWidening broadband deployment and spectrum auction\\nFollowing the implementation of the 8-Point Agenda, the country was able to achieve and surpass its broadband penetration target of 30 per cent by the end of December, 2018, a feat that got commendations.\\n\\nVarious efforts of the Commission in licensing new spectrum bands, re-farming certain frequency bands and driving initiatives for increased broadband infrastructure in the country have also been responsible for these feats.\\n\\nWith increase in broadband penetration being recorded on a monthly basis, stakeholders have said that the NCC is well positioned and must be supported by the government through relevant policies to drive the actualisation of the country’s digital economy policy strategy, going forward.\\n\\nThis has become necessary since, as usual; the Commission is expected to take the driver’s seat in the actualisation of the new broadband target being worked on by the Ministry of Communication and Digital Economy. Just recently, the new National Broadband Plan for 2020-2025 was unveiled by President Muhammadu Buhari. This targets 70 per cent broadband penetration in the next five years.\\n\\nDanbatta made it clear that henceforth, access to broadband, which stands at 39.5 per cent, will become a fundamental metrics for measuring development growth and development in Nigeria, as it will be central to the growth recorded in every other sector of the economy where telecoms would be driving services automation and digitisation.\\n\\nAlready, six Infrastructure Companies (InfraCos) have been licensed by NCC to take broadband in an Open Access Model to the 774 Local Government Areas of the country.\\n\\n\\nNigeria saves N15 billion through IXP, as Internet traffic goes local\\n8 hours ago\\nLagos tasks youths on tech talent development, graduates 18\\n8 hours ago\\nGlobal eWaste sees 21% rise as Africa generates 2.9 metric tones\\n8 hours ago\\n\\nExecutive Commissioner, Stakeholders Management, Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), Adeleke Adewolu (left); Executive Vice Chairman/CEO,NCC, Prof. Umar Garba Danbatta; Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr. Isa Ali Ibrahim Pantami, and Executive Commissioner, Technical Services, NCC, Ubale Maska, during a Courtesy visit to the Minister, Abuja, on Monday.\\n\\nAs the saying goes, the reward for hard work is more work. This aptly fits the present circumstances surrounding the Executive Vice Chairman, Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), Prof. Umar Danbatta, who has successfully earned a second term of five years in office.\\n\\nDanbatta, who was appointed into office on August 4, 2015, for his first term, has had it good, bad and ugly. But, analysts believe that his positive contributions to the industry outweigh the downside of his first five years as the chief executive officer of NCC.\\n\\nIt is on this premise that the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Pantami, who recommended Danbatta to President Muhammadu Buhari for a second term, called on the EVC and his team to redouble their efforts towards actualising the digital economy agenda of the Federal Government.\\n\\nThe Minister spoke when the Executive Management of the Commission led by Danbatta paid him a courtesy visit on Monday.\\n\\n\\nAccording to the Minister, the proactive decision to recommend Danbatta’s reappointment to the President for approval was “to ensure stability in the telecommunications industry and consolidate on the gains and successes already recorded in the industry in the last five years of Danbatta’s leadership as the EVC of NCC.”\\n\\nPantami, however, emphasised the need for the Danbatta-led NCC Management to work more harmoniously with the Ministry and agencies, towards ensuring effective implementation of the National Digital Economy Policy and Strategy (NDEPS) as well as thorough implementation of the new National Broadband Plan (NBP), 2020-2025.\\n\\n“The success of the Commission is our collective responsibility. While we, as a Ministry, do our best to formulate general industry policy and supervise the activities of the Commission, I will urge the NCC family to be united, remove all lines of demarcation, ensure justice, fairness in all decisions and above all, ensure harmonious relationships. This task lies on the table of the EVC,” he pointed out.\\n\\nSpeaking further, Pantami reminded the EVC that the focus of President Buhari is currently to boost the digital economy, which, he said, has become even more important following the experience of COVID-19 pandemic that has left many individuals and organisations relying more on digital platforms for work and collaboration.\\n\\n“So, we expect the NCC, as the telecoms regulator, to take the issue of the digital economy very seriously and give it all the attention it deserves within the Commission,” he said.\\n\\nProtecting small telcos\\nWhile congratulating the EVC for earning a second term in office, the Chairman of the Association of Licensed Telecoms Operators of Nigeria (ALTON), Gbenga Adebayo, said his reappointment is a testimony of his good leadership under, which the industry has made significant progress.\\n\\nGoing forward, Adebayo, an engineer, tasked the EVC on the need for the regulator to protect the smaller players and ensure they survive in the interest of competition and the consumers.\\n\\nThe ALTON chairman posited that Danbatta’s second term will bring about consistency for the progress of the industry.\\n\\nOn his part, the President of the Association of Telecommunications Companies of Nigeria (ATCON), Olusola Teniola, said the EVC needs to ensure that the Nigerian Broadband Plan 2020-25 is implemented in a timely manner, and that lessons learnt from the 2013-18 plan should be adhered to, to avoid the painful mistakes identified in the current plan.\\n\\nTeniola said the focus should be on affordability of Internet access and the digital transformation the industry needs to undertake for continued relevancy in the digital realm.\\n\\n\\n“We are behind in fibre rollout and behind in 4G coverage, so NCC under his leadership needs to fully collaborate with ATCON members and the wider industry stakeholders to build a robust digital infrastructure that is fit for purpose\\n\\n“Finally, it is well recognised that as an industry and during COVID-19 lockdown directives that our networks are heavily relied on to act as an enabling platform for the Nigerian Digital Economy. For that to be the case the industry needs to fund the building of such platform as envisioned in the Nigerian Broadband Plan in a spirit of collaboration. This means that the industry will be undergoing tremendous change to adapt to the new norm. Digital skills are paramount and these skills are required for the continued growth of our industry,” he stressed.\\n\\nStakeholders call for collaborations\\nFor the sector to thrive better, especially in the next five years, stakeholders have called for collaboration among operators and the regulator.\\n\\nManaging Director of Rack Centre, Tunde Coker, the sector is capable of increasing its contributions from the current 14 per cent to 20 per cent in another two years, if government can pivot away from oil and give ICT a diversification priority.\\n\\nCoker said collaboration between the regulator and players in the sector will play an important role\\nin positioning the sector positively.\\n\\nChief Executive Officer (CEO) VDT Communication, Biodun Omoniyi, COVID-19 brought huge responsibility on the sector, “and we didn’t fail. However, lots still need to be done post-pandemic. Collaborations among players and governments at all levels will be key.”\\n\\nThe Country Manager, Avanti, Jane Egerton-Idehen, made case for faster implementation of the New National Broadband Plan 2020 to 2025, where she stressed the need for collaboration, especially between the sector and states governments that will further see to reduction of Right of Ways,” as COVID-19 has further stretched the timing for some aspect of the plan to be realised.”\\n\\nThe last five years\\nMeanwhile, part of the developments that came to the industry was an increase in the sector’s investment.\\n\\nFor instance, four years ago, the investment profile of the sector was around $38 billion. But today, it has grown to over $70 billion. Despite this, the telecom regulator has admitted the present investment in the sector is inadequate and will continue to pursue policies that would encourage more investment, stressing that Nigeria is one of the fastest growing telecommunications markets in the world.\\n\\n\\nSpeaking at the maiden Nigerian Telecom Leadership Summit (NTLS) held in Lagos last year (2019), Danbatta, admitted: “The volume of telecom investment in Nigeria is very impressive and indicative of a very fast-growing and resilient sector of the economy.

Between August 2015 and February 2019, when teledensity was measured against the 140 population in Nigeria, teledensity increased from 107.87 to 124.05 per cent. However, after rebasing the country’s teledensity to 91 per cent in February, 2019, in line with international best practice and economic reality, teledensity has impressively increased from 91 per cent to 99.16 per cent as of March, 2020.\\n\\nInternet subscribers increased from 90 million in 2015 to 136.2 million as of March, 2020. Broadband penetration increased from eight per cent in 2015 to 39.90 per cent in March, 2020. This indicates that 76.2 million Nigerians are now on broadband networks of 3G and 4G in the country.\\n\\nAlso, the number of subscribers that have subscribed to Mobile Number Portability (MNP) service increased from 385, 617 in August 2015 to 1075047 as of March, 2020. This is due to increased public education and awareness by the Commission’s head office and its zonal offices, as they intensified awareness on the availability and usage of MNP across geo-political zones.\\n\",\"createdAt\":\"2020-07-01T12:54:57.117Z\",\"creatorId\":\"UbDb4ITEdd-J\"},{\"_id\":\"xLpDGOpkG3aCq1Gia-SfZ\",\"image_link\":\"https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Isa-Ali-Pantami.jpg\",\"caption\":\" How to move Nigeria’s digital transformation forward, by experts\",\"author\":\"\",\"source\":\"Guardian\",\"source_link\":\"https://guardian.ng/technology/how-to-move-nigerias-digital-transformation-forward-by-experts/\",\"category\":\"tech_inno\",\"headings\":\"not\",\"abstract_cat\":\"none\",\"content\":\"Digital transformation in government can exponentially improve the lives of its citizens, providing more efficient and positive experiences that build trust, experts have said.\\n\\nSpecifically, they said technology is changing lives at spectacular speed.

This makes e-waste the world’s fastest-growing domestic waste stream, fueled mainly by higher consumption rates of electric and electronic equipment, short life cycles, and few options for repair.\\n\\nAccording to UN, only 17.4 per cent of 2019’s e-waste was collected and recycled. This means that gold, silver, copper, platinum and other high-value, recoverable materials conservatively valued at $57 billion — a sum greater than the gross domestic product of most countries – were mostly dumped or burned rather than being collected for treatment and reuse.\\n\\nAccording to the report, Asia generated the greatest volume of e-waste in 2019 — about 24.9 Mt, followed by the Americas (13.1 Mt) and Europe (12 Mt), while Africa and Oceania generated 2.9 Mt and 0.7 Mt, respectively.\\n\\nFor perspective, last year’s e-waste weighed substantially more than all the adults in Europe, or as much as 350 cruise ships the size of the Queen Mary 2, enough to form a line 125 km long.\\n\\nE-waste is a health and environmental hazard, containing toxic additives or hazardous substances such as mercury, which damages the human brain and / or coordination system.\\n\\nOther key findings from the Global E-waste Monitor 2020 include that proper e-waste management can help mitigate global warming. In 2019, an estimated 98 Mt of CO2-equivalents were released into the atmosphere from discarded fridges and air-conditioners, contributing roughly 0.3 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions.\\n\\nIn per capita terms, last year’s discarded e-waste averaged 7.3 kg for every man, woman and child on Earth.\\n\\nIt further revealed that Europe ranked first worldwide in terms of e-waste generation per capita with 16.2 kg per capita. Oceania came second (16.1 kg) followed by the Americas (13.3 kg). Asia and Africa were much lower: 5.6 and 2.5 kg respectively.\\n\\nAccording to UN, eWaste remains a health and environmental hazard, containing toxic additives or hazardous substances such as mercury, which damages the human brain and / or coordination system. An estimated 50 tonnes of mercury — used in monitors, PCBs and fluorescent and energy-saving light sources — are contained in undocumented flows of e-waste annually.\\n\\nThe report informed that eWaste in 2019 was mainly comprised of small equipment (17.4 Mt), large equipment (13.1 Mt), and temperature exchange equipment (10.8 Mt). Screens and monitors, lamps, small IT, and telecommunication equipment represented 6.7 Mt, 4.7 Mt, and 0.9 Mt respectively.\\n\\nUN noted that since 2014, the eWaste categories increasing fastest in total weight terms are: temperature exchange equipment (+7 per cent), large equipment (+5 per cent), lamps and small equipment (+4 per cent).\\n\\nAccording to the report, this trend is driven by the growing consumption of those products in lower-income countries, where those products improve the living standards. Small IT and telecommunication equipment have been growing more slowly, and screens and monitors have shown a slight decrease (-1 per cent), explained largely by lighter flat panel displays replacing heavy cathode ray tube (CRT) monitors and screens.\\n\\nIt however, revealed that since 2014, the number of countries that have adopted a national e-waste policy, legislation or regulation has increased from 61 to 78. While a positive trend, this is far from the target set by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) which is to raise the percentage of countries with an eWaste legislation to 50 per cent.\\n\",\"createdAt\":\"2020-07-01T12:35:12.509Z\",\"creatorId\":\"UbDb4ITEdd-J\"},{\"_id\":\"3ALIAmoc9CSvdaowXxrAI\",\"image_link\":\"https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Feature_Image_Tosin_Faniro_Dada.jpg\",\"caption\":\"Lagos tasks youths on tech talent development, graduates 18\",\"author\":\"\",\"source\":\"Guardian\",\"source_link\":\"https://guardian.ng/technology/lagos-tasks-youths-on-tech-talent-development-graduates-18/\",\"category\":\"tech_inno\",\"headings\":\"tech_inno\",\"abstract_cat\":\"top_stories\",\"content\":\"Lagos State Government through the State Employment Trust Fund (LSETF), has tasked youths on the need to become more creative, and develop competencies in information, and communication technology (ICT).\\n\\nSpeaking at the virtual graduation ceremony of the first cohort of 18 students that participated in the Lagos Innovates Talent Development Programme, an initiative by Honeywell Group and the LSETF, the Implementation Manager, LSETF, Tosin Faniro-Dada, said ICT is key to 21st Century development.\\n\\nShe said: “In a time of so much disruption and uncertainty, your graduation brings rays of excitement and some sense of normalcy.

She was later placed on admission because the drugs administered on her weren’t working. She said it was one of the doctors that later suggested she gets tested for COVID-19.\\n\\nThe COVID-19 test result came back positive and according to her, the experience afterwards was horrific before she tested negative on June 27.\\n\\n“If I had 10,000 tongues, it still wouldn’t be enough, Na re ke Le mooooo! Last week, someone sent me a message and said, Ife, you’re the ‘E’ in extra and I love it.. I’ve accepted the title.\\n\\nJune tested my existence. From the first day to the end! Everyday was a horror movie. On the first of June, I woke up in soooo much pain! It started with headaches first, then body pains. I went into the hospital and I was diagnosed of a bacterial infection.\\n\\nI wasn’t surprised with the result because someone who was also with me had also tested for bacterial infection in a totally different hospital, so I just took the meds they gave me and went home. Later that evening, my head was pounding like a machine. My body felt like someone was using a hammer to hit it all over. My temperature was extremely high, the pain all over was UNBEARABLE! I went back into the hospital at midnight, this time, I was admitted.\\n\\nThey gave me more pain meds through IV… NOTHING WORKED. I was restless, in pain, I begged for sleeping pills so I could forget the pain. Obviously, they didn’t give me. I was wide awake all night.\\n\\nThe next day… I was discharged with a new set of meds. All they gave me didn’t work. I decided to chest it. I went back on Friday and Saturday to complain that I wasn’t getting better… at this point, I couldn’t really talk again. It felt like I had 3 safety pins in my throat and the inner part of my neck was sewn together. I couldn’t talk..nothing.\\n\\nThen a doctor randomly said I should just try to get tested for COVID since nothing was working, she then gave me a number to one of the centers on the island. I called them, till date, they didn’t get back to me.\\n\\nI then decided to take matters into my own hands.. I had an AGS Tribe members husband who was a doctor, I called him immediately to tell him I wanted to get tested, unfortunately, he wasn’t on land, so he couldn’t test me… then one of my egbons sent a doctor to my house that night… I got tested with the Rapid Antigen test and I was POSITIVE! My life flashed before my eyes…\\n\\nOnce I found out. I called my hospital… the one that admitted me to let them know, so they could disinfect the place etc and also check if I could get any medical care from them. Alas, they told me there was a care package they sent to their patients etc and asked for my address, that they’d get it delivered… 30mins later, I got a call that they wouldn’t be delivering it again because my result wasn’t from NIMR or NCDC. I wept! They literarily abandoned me.\\n\\nMy self isolation started. The pain was continuous. I had to buy Zithromax 500mg (azithromycin), Zinc 10mg, Vit c 1000(effervescent) 1 daily\\nMethodex cough syrup\\nThen the chloroquine (pls don’t buy these drugs without proper medical diagnosis)\\n\\nAnytime I took the Methodex, it felt like I was drinking fire! I cried. Jumped everything each time I took it! I was porging uncontrollably. There was a time I felt like I wanted to poo, I got up and I saw the poo on the floor! I couldn’t even laugh, poo would come out. I couldn’t sit up or hold a conversation for 30mins, I’ll be dizzy and weak. It was a NIGHTMARE! Literarily one month of terror. The dizziness didn’t stop. I also had to do the hot water and aboliki steam inhalation, drink the lemon and ginger mix. Everything.\\n\\nOn the 15th, I went to NIMR to do another test, I was still positive. I couldn’t even stand straight. It was horrific. I sent a message to my doctor to let them know I now had the result from NIMR and it was still positive. The response I got was ‘OK’, no empathy, no nothing, no ‘hope you feel better’ nothing. I’m so thankful for the Doctor who got me tested and the AGS members husband, Dr. Kayode who literally took care of me like…. they picked up my calls at midnight, early morning. They never got tired. Always advising me and telling me what to use or buy! It was a horrific period. On top of everything, my sister passed on, on my late brothers birthday, Aunty Ibidun passed, Lamide was murdered, many died from COVID… June was a huge mess.\\n\\nBut I’m moving on. Finally, on the 27th, I was tested negative and I’m just here to thank God and you all know that COVID19 is BLOODY REAL! I did everything, washed my hands, sanitized, used masks and shields but I still got it AT HOME. I do not wish the pain I felt in the last month on my enemy! Please stay safe. You don’t know how your body will react to the virus. Mine was crazy but I’m thankful my breathing wasn’t affected.\\n\\nDuring this time, my support system was LIT! @ajilawson of @kstonecc kept on calling to pray with me, @funkebucknor @derojuoa, thank you so much for the communion. @tunde_ode , my friends, my family, Lord, I’m grateful. God bless you all. Even though I was in isolation, I never felt alone. Thankful\\n\\nPS: I tried to do video recordings of how I felt every 3 days, maybe I’ll share them later.”\",\"createdAt\":\"2020-07-01T12:02:47.919Z\",\"creatorId\":\"UbDb4ITEdd-J\"},{\"_id\":\"zZ6bopW0iwziPmCRoOEUD\",\"image_link\":\"https://lailasnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/it-was-an-artistic-expression-608x325.jpg\",\"caption\":\"‘It was an Artistic expression’ – Akuapem Poloo clears the air over viral photo with her son\",\"author\":\"Damilola Ismail\",\"source\":\"Lailasnews\",\"source_link\":\"https://lailasnews.com/it-was-an-artistic-expression-akuapem-poloo-clears-the-air-over-viral-photo-with-her-son-video/\",\"category\":\"celebrities\",\"headings\":\"not\",\"abstract_cat\":\"none\",\"content\":\"Actress Akuapem Poloo after several backlash for the picture she used in wishing her son a happy birthday, made a video to clear the air.\\n\\nAccording to Akuapem Poloo, every post she makes on her social media page is to send a message since she is an artiste and they are also expressions of her artistic personality.\\n\\nTherefore, she said the picture that quickly went viral with her son, was an artistic expression of motherhood and a message to those who do not respect women and their mothers.\",\"createdAt\":\"2020-07-01T12:00:05.207Z\",\"creatorId\":\"UbDb4ITEdd-J\"},{\"_id\":\"Hts2JiKAJZ1DY8ZqWCMXE\",\"image_link\":\"https://lailasnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Anita-Joseph-slams-actress-Akupem-Poloo-who-posed-naked-with-son-on-his-birthday-lailasnews-600x400.jpg\",\"caption\":\"Anita Joseph slams actress, Akupem Poloo who posed naked with son on his birthday\",\"author\":\"Tolulope Ayeni\",\"source\":\"Lailasnews\",\"source_link\":\"https://lailasnews.com/anita-joseph-slams-actress-akupem-poloo-who-posed-naked-with-son-on-his-birthday/\",\"category\":\"celebrities\",\"headings\":\"not\",\"abstract_cat\":\"none\",\"content\":\"The actress while celebrating the son’s birthday, had taken to Instagram to post a photo of herself standing before the little boy, stark naked.\\n\\nShe stated that she decided to go nude because she wasn’t wearing any clothe on the day she gave birth to him.

Buhari said this while speaking at the virtual flag-off ceremony of the project at the Ajaokuta, Kogi State and Rigachikun, Kaduna State camp sites simultaneously.\\n\\nGovernors Yahaya Bello of Kogi State and Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna flagged off the commencement of works at Ajaokuta and Rigachikun sites, while the President watched remotely via video-conference from the Council Chamber in Abuja. The President, who directed the NNPC and partners to remain focused, said the AKK project was part of the delivery of the present administration’s Next Level Agenda for sustainable development, enhancement of economic prosperity and increase of the country’s infrastructure assets. He expressed government’s commitment to ensure timely delivery of the landmark gas pipeline project within budgetary allocation and specifications. “We promised the nation that we will expand the critical gas infrastructure in the country to promote the use of gas in the domestic market. These include the Escravos to Lagos Pipeline System – 2 (ELPS-2), Obiafu to Obrikom (OB3) pipeline and AKK. “These projects are fundamental to our desire to industrialize and energize the entrepreneurial spirit that is ever present in our population,” the President added. On the benefits of the project scheduled for completion in two years, Buhari said it would provide gas for generation of power and for gas-based industries and facilitate the development of new industries. The President said it will also ensure the revival of moribund industries along transit towns in Kogi State, Abuja (FCT), Niger State, Kaduna State and Kano State, adding that the cascading effect and impact of the AKK, when operational, will be immeasurable. He appealed to Governors of Kogi, Niger, Kaduna and Kano States as well as the Minister of the Federal Capital Territory to provide the enabling environment and support for the project. The President lauded the government of the People’s Republic of China; the  financiers the Bank of China and SINOSURE; and the two EPC Contractors (Brentex/China Petroleum Pipeline Bureau-CPP Consortia and Oilserve/China First Highway Engineering Company-CFHEC Consortia) for their support to deliver the important project. In his remarks, Group Managing Director, Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Malam Mele Kyari, said the AKK gas pipeline project, which is part of the Trans-Nigeria gas pipeline project, involved the establishment of a connecting gas pipeline network that will integrate the Northern region of the country with the Niger Delta, Eastern and Western regions of the Country. Kyari said the EPC contract for the 614km AKK gas pipeline project was awarded at a total contract sum of US$2.592 billion to Messrs.

Foreign exchange inflows in Nigeria have taken a hit from a plunge in crude oil prices, which account for 90% of such earnings.\\n\\nSpeaking at its virtual annual investor conference media roundtable, CEO of EFG Hermes Frontier, Ali Khalpey, noted that the progress made by Nigeria in the last 15 years needs to be sustained, and policies have to be accelerated to drive growth and investments.\\n\\n“Liberalisation policies need to be accelerated. You can’t trap people into markets, because once they are able to get out, they won’t get in again. Nigeria needs to be compelling to attract needed capital into the country,” he added.\\n\\nNigeria’s ability to attract sustainable foreign direct investments (FDIs) remained weak, as the bulk of imported capital continues to be dominated by portfolio investments, otherwise known as ‘hot money’.\\n\\nWith oil prices remaining unstable, there are concerns about the quality of investment attracted into the economy, especially when investors are becoming jittery about the stability of the Naira, and Nigeria’s capacity to service its debts.\\n\\nOf the $5.85billion received in the first quarter (Q1) of 2020, portfolio investment accounted for 73.61% ($4.31billion) of the total capital importation recorded by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).\\n\\nHead of Frontier Research, Kato Mukuru, reiterated the need to allow policies to drive investments, noting that investors will make in-roads to sectors that show clarity and growth potential.\\n\\nOn weakened consumption, he said: “There is a lot of uncertainty as regards consumption. There is a huge gap in the exchange rates. What we need to do is go back to the days where there is no gap in the exchange rates. People are not going to spend money when they are not sure about price stability. Foreign exchange is key to the whole thing. We are forecasting N420/$1 by the end of the year.\\n\\n“We also seek clarity on policies, taxation and intervention affecting consumer spending. Once the market gets clarity, things will change.”\\nChief Executive Office, EFG Hermes Holding, Karim Awad, said: “The conference is being held in the middle of significant global economic changes as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have effects, with special challenges facing Frontier Emerging Markets (FEMs). Lockdowns and the resultant decrease in global trade earnings, coupled with a contraction in portfolio inflows have strained several countries’ financial positions.\\n\\n“Meanwhile, the rapid fall in oil and commodity prices has put pressure on those countries, which are dependent on natural resource extraction. International credit rating agencies have downgraded significant stocks of FEM debt, while hundreds of countries have approached the IMF for emergency funding.”\\n\\nDespite current challenges facing FEMs, co-CEO of the Investment Bank at EFG Hermes, Mohamed Ebeid, believes changes in the macro picture might create new opportunities for countries, markets and companies.\\n\\nHe said: “We do see the prospect of some relief from immediate pressures, with an easing of FEM portfolio outflows expected as major central banks continuing to implement large expansionary programs. We could also see a floor put under commodity price drops as major oil producers solidify their commitment to large output cuts.”\\n\\n“Investors and executives will nevertheless have to navigate a changed landscape, where previously more-or-less hidden structural trends come to the fore and accelerate. A main objective of the Virtual Investor Conference is to provide participants with first-hand insights from key international players, spurring further investment in FEMs.”\",\"createdAt\":\"2020-07-01T01:34:35.286Z\",\"creatorId\":\"UbDb4ITEdd-J\"},{\"_id\":\"ckOJ0EGtCfPNOXHv5YiJf\",\"image_link\":\"https://i1.wp.com/www.pmnewsnigeria.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Taraba-State-Governor-Darius-Isiaku.jpg?resize=750%2C622&ssl=1\",\"caption\":\"2021: Zoning over in Anambra State – Group\",\"author\":\"Emmanuel Uzodinma\",\"source\":\"DailyPost\",\"source_link\":\"https://dailypost.ng/2020/06/30/2021-zoning-over-in-anambra-state-group/\",\"category\":\"politics\",\"headings\":\"not\",\"abstract_cat\":\"none\",\"content\":\"A pan-Igbo youth organisation, Anambra Ekunie, on Tuesday cautioned against the promoting of discord and social fragmentation in Anambra State using the zoning of the 2021 governorship election.\\n\\nIt asked those using the zoning claims as a shield to desist from further seeking to balkanize the state, as the idea of zoning ended with the election of Governor Willie Obiano.\\n\\nRising from an emergency meeting in Enugu, the group said the insistence by Anambra South that Gov. Obiano’s successor must come from the area, was an unacceptable act of provocation aimed at intimidating other zones to submission.\\n\\nAccording to the group, Anambra state remains one and cannot be balkanized by political merchants who see zoning as an avenue to impose someone who will be subservient to them as governor over the state.\\n\\nA statement signed by President of the group, Dr. Ifeanyi Achusi, said every zone of the state was qualified to contest for the governorship as power had effectively rotated among the three zones since 1999. It said none of the senatorial zones can honestly say it has not taken a chance at governing Anambra state since 1999.\\n\\nThe group also said that Anambra South lacked the moral credibility to insist that it must produce Obiano’s successor since politicians from the zone have contested in every governorship election in the state since 1999.\\n\\n“We are disturbed by the outcome of a recent meeting of Anambra south political and traditional leaders where they insisted that the zone must produce the next governor in 2021. It seems to us that some politicians are beginning to use the traditional institution to drive a political agenda that could balkanize the state.\\n\\n“Our cause for worry is that the zone is beginning to act like it can intimidate other zones of Anambra state into submission and silence. That cannot happen. Anambra state belongs to all of us and the governorship of the state is open to every Anambra son and daughter who wants to contest.\\n\\n“We cannot surrender the state to the whims of Anambra south traditional rulers and politicians including the state chapter of Ohanaeze Ndigbo. That is not possible. Ohanaeze Ndigbo has no say on which zone produces the governor of any state in the southeast. It must not interfere in the internal political issues of any state.\\n\\n“For emphasis, Anambra South has had the most opportunities to govern the state since 1999. If they failed to make the best use of the opportunity, they cannot now say they were cheated. No one cheated them. If you failed to graduate from the university, it will be uncharitable for you to go telling people that your father did not send you to the university.\\n\\n“Also, we recall that Prince Nicholas Ukachukwu, Sen. Andy Uba, Sen. Ikechukwu Obiora, Hon. Chuma Nzeribe, Prof. Charles Soludo, Barr. KOP Odidika, Engr. Betram Dim, Dr. Amanchukwu Ezike, Dr. Harry Oranezi, Barr. Obinna Uzor, Barr. Damian Okolo, all from Anambra south, were cleared by the PDP to contest the 2010 governorship election against Obi. Ukachukwu and Uba however moved over to Hope Democratic Party and Labour Party to become their governorship candidates after Prof. Soludo picked the PDP ticket.\\n\\n“We are aware that politicians from Anambra South have consistently contested in every governorship election in Anambra state. There has never been a time when they pulled out on the grounds that it was the turn of another zone. They contested when Chris Ngige was imposed on us by one of them.\\n\\n“They contested when Peter Obi was elected for a second term. They contested when Obiano was elected for both his first and second terms. If per chance any of them had won then, would they come now to sing zoning?\\n\\n“There is no doubt that Anambra state rotates the governorship among the three senatorial zones. But as it is now, all the zones have taken their turns. So, the logical thing to do is to begin the rotation afresh from the zone that wins the 2021 governorship election, not to ask others to stay away and only you to present candidates. That has never been done in Anambra state and will not begin now. Anambra South has no right to disenfranchise any zone of the state. Every qualified Anambra person has the right to vote and also to be voted for.\\n\\n“In fact, Anambra Ekunie is insisting that it is now the turn of Anambra people to elect their governor. We are done with the imposition of a governor on us. Our people must now rise to demand that their votes count and it must count for the most credible and most competent.\\n\\nLet all who are interested, male and female, young and old, from all the zones, enter the ring and let the people make their choice. That is our stand”, the statement read.\\n\\nAnambra Ekunie had in March also warned the Elders’ Council in the state against allowing itself to be used by the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) to market an internal policy of the party as a statewide decision that is binding on all citizens.\\n\\nIt had told the Elders’ Council that APGA’s decision to zone its governorship ticket to Anambra South is strictly a decision of the party which can not be binding on other political parties in the state.\",\"createdAt\":\"2020-07-01T01:26:00.345Z\",\"creatorId\":\"UbDb4ITEdd-J\"},{\"_id\":\"pKkMGknoaUCbrigXHNHFG\",\"image_link\":\"https://i1.wp.com/www.pmnewsnigeria.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Taraba-State-Governor-Darius-Isiaku.jpg?resize=750%2C622&ssl=1\",\"caption\":\"Edo: COVID-19 response team protest over unpaid stipends\",\"author\":\" Timothy Omobude\",\"source\":\"DailyPost\",\"source_link\":\"https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_20200630_124014_346-1024x461.jpg\",\"category\":\"politics\",\"headings\":\"not\",\"abstract_cat\":\"none\",\"content\":\"Workers in the Edo state COVID-19 response team on Tuesday protested none payment of their stipends.\\n\\nThe protesters blocked the entrance gate to the office of the Hospital Management Board, HMB, in Benin City, the state capital.\\n\\nOne of the leaders of the protesters, Ojeme Emmanuel said some of them have only collected staggered days stipends for the number of days worked for in the month of April.
